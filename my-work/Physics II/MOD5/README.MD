This is a repo for all the physics work , thesis, abstracts, and course work I did for 4000 level physics class. This is for my personal reference and usage. Please feel free to view and critique my work or contact me if you&#39;re interested in working on an abstract that I have published based on the course work.

**Physics and Imaging the Brain**

The study of physics has resulted in a number of technological developments in medicine. Some of the most significant improvements in our understanding of the human body come from sophisticated medical imaging. Before we could image the inside of the body, people had to rely on direct observations provided by dissection. It has certainly been a great improvement for society that doctors can use physics to safely and accurately, not to mention painlessly, look inside of the human body.

The field of medical imaging includes any method that is used to create an image of the inside of the body. Some of the common imaging techniques that will be discussed in this lecture are radiography, ultrasound, and MRI scanning. Many diseases are diagnosed and treated using different types of imaging, but we can also learn more than just what is not working correctly in the body. Perhaps most importantly, medical imaging can be used to study how the brain works - how we think, learn, and feel. In this lecture, we will focus on what imaging can tell us about the brain and how we can apply that knowledge to understanding ourselves as humans.

The X-Men?

One of the oldest techniques used to see inside of the human body was developed at the end of the 19th century. Since that time, radiography has advanced significantly. X-ray are high-energy electromagnetic radiation that easily passes through the soft tissues of the body, creating an image of harder structures such as bone. X-rays are also used in computed tomography where computer technology is used to turn the X-ray data into image &quot;slices&quot; of the object. X-rays are ionizing radiation and can be very dangerous to living tissue. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to cause tissue damage and cancer. The radiation dosage of modern X-ray equipment is carefully controlled but radiation exposure remains an important consideration when deciding on what type of imaging to use.

Another type of imaging uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of the interior organs of the body. Ultrasound imaging or sonography does not use ionizing radiation and so is generally very safe to use and the equipment is relatively inexpensive and portable. There are many different way to use ultrasound technology including to image internal organs and in obstetrics.

Imagine all the protons, living life in peace...

In the rest of this lecture we will focus on magnetic resonance imaging or MRI. This technique relies on using extremely strong magnetic fields and requires very expensive and specialized equipment. The magnetic field strength inside an MRI machine can be more than 10,000 times stronger than the Earth&#39;s magnetic field. In order to achieve this field strength, the magnet needs to be cooled to almost absolute zero, creating a superconducting magnet. MRI scans can be conducted on almost any part of the body and do not use ionizing radiation and so are relatively safe.

The strong magnetic field passing through the body cause the protons in water molecules to align with the field. A radio frequency wave is then turned on, causing some of the protons to align differently. When the radio wave is turned off, the protons return to their preferred state and give off energy. This energy is used to create an images of different structures in the body. Sophisticated computers are used to analyze the data and produce the images. The computer technology is almost important as the physics; without sophisticated programs, the data collected would be very difficult to interpret.

Neuroimaging is a rapidly advancing part of the neuroscience field. The use of MRI scans has provided researches with a significant amount of interesting and valuable data about the brain and how it operates. The field of neuroscience is extremely large and diverse in its research so we will only look at a few of the questions that scientists are trying to answer, including how we learn, the effects of sleep deprivation on brain, what dreams can tell us about how the mind works, and if it is possible to use neuroimaging to read someone&#39;s thoughts.

Imagine how we learn

Imaging the brain can provide a lot of information about how we think and learn. Because language is fundamental to how we communicate, the understanding and processing of language is one of the more important areas of research. Through MRI scanning, research has discovered that learning a foreign language can protect our minds as we age. From studying how the brain processes language, we can even determine the optimal method for a specific individual to learn a new language. We can even use the normal functioning of the brain to help rehabilitate patients when the brain is damaged or stops functioning correctly.

Neuroimaging also helps us to understand what happens to the brain when we are sleep deprived. By examining which parts of the brain are activated for a well-rested person and then for the same individual experiencing sleep deprivation, scientists have been able to identify how sleep impacts our brain. When we lack sleep, it can be seen that the decision making centers of our brain are less active. But studies have also found a corresponding increase of activity in the brain centers that respond to rewards. There seems to be a connection between these reward centers and craving high-calorie foods when lacking sleep. But not all of the news is bad! It seems that our brains can learn to compensate for the lack of sleep by activating certain areas. This could provide insight into how to designs the best schedules for shift works and what types of jobs or tasks may be suitable for those individuals who may experience regular sleep deprivation.

Do androids dream of electric sheep?

We have always been interested in our dreams and what they tells us about ourselves. Using MRI scanning, scientists have been able to determine the visual content of actual dreams! Research subjects were scanned while dreaming and also provided detailed written accounts of the images in their dreams. Matching these written accounts to the MRI images of the dreaming brain allowed scientists to identify the images the subjects were dreaming about when they were scanned during new dreams. There are many applications for this type of research and it may be especially helpful for those individuals who cannot communicate verbally.

The Dream Police?

Finally, the important question: can we use MRI or other imaging technology to actually read someone&#39;s thought? So far, scientists have not yet determined how to do this. They have made advances in understanding how the brain makes decisions and even predicting certain decisions based on brain scan images. They have also identified when a person being scanned is thinking about a certain category of objects.

But, the results from numerous research studies indicate that we are a long way from being able to use technology, at least discretely, in order to read someone&#39;s mind. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that human thought includes an emotional aspect, making it difficult to predict how a certain image might correlate to a particular thought. In the end, people are individuals, with individual minds, and while there are certainly similar patterns in how we think and process information, it seems that there is a lot more to the mind than we currently understand.
