When creating data visualizations, it is not simply creating graphs from datasets. Your visualization should help tell a story. While telling that story, you should consider effects such as how certain proximity, orientation, size, and color may be interpreted by the audience.

**Proximity**
Consider this unique visualization,[&quot;Who Old Are You?&quot;](http://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/who-old-are-you/). Once the user&#39;s age has been calculated, the visualization displays various categories: average age, career high, creative zenith, life moment, and worldly success on a timeline based on age. The tooltip displays highlights of moments from companies, historical and political figures, major life changes, and so on. The combination of the timeline and use of shapes and color key makes it easy to click and view the various highlights.

_Information is Beautiful. &quot;The UK&#39;s Brexit Options in the Eurozone Landscape – Visualized._

However, sometimes using shapes like this can be misleading. Some may think the circles are somehow **related**.

**Orientation**
Consider the following complicated visualization,[&quot;Eurozones, the Brexit Landscape&quot;](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/the-uks-brexit-options-in-the-eurozone-landscape-visualized/), which attempts to clarify the complex structure of the European Union and the UK&#39;s various routes and options for Brexit.

_Information is Beautiful. &quot;The UK&#39;s Brexit Options in the Eurozone Landscape – Visualized.&quot;_

Because the story the author attempts to tell using this visualization is a complicated one, using a landscape orientation versus portrait may be the best option for the layout. Readers tend to immediately perceive the difference between **vertical** and **horizontal** orientation.

**Size**
Readers tend to quickly discern differences in size and assume the odd one is the one worth noting.

**Color**
Readers tend to immediately notice differences in color and assume groupings based on similar colors.

**Shape**
Readers tend to perceive differences in shapes, but not necessarily as efficiently as we identify proximity, color, size, and orientation.

Below is a general checklist you should follow when creating data visualizations and dashboards:

**Color** :

- Do your colors clash?
- Did your check for color blindness?
- Will your viz be displayed in color or grayscale?
- Are all of your color choices necessary? Could you use shapes instead?

**Comprehension** :

- Are your fonts/labels consistent and readable?
- Are your font choices optimized for print or online display?
- Does your visualization need a caption, subtitle, or other explanatory text?
- Does your visualization have a key/legend?

**Format**

- Who is your target audience?
- Is your final product going to be static or interactive?

**Rights**

- Is your data cited properly?
- Do you need a rights or reuse statement?
