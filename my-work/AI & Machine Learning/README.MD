**Machine Learning Overview**

This section contains my collective works based on educational research and applications I was taught and have taught myself impart to highlight my skills and aptitudes in the field of AI and subset fields of Machine Learning, Deep Learning reinforcement Learning Computer vision , GANS, and many other subset fields in relation to my skills. Please note this is open source simply to highlight the extent of my knowledge in the given field.

If you would like to download codesets and need practice data sets please contact me I will be happy to send them to you. If you are an employer researcher or peer reviewer please see my portfolio section of Work which incorporates the work I have done on my own and collaborations with other data scientists..
