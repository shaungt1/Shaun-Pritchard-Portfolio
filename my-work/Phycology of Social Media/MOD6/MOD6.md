### **Social Media and Real Life**

When the personal computer arrived on the scene, it wasn&#39;t good for much more than word processing and basic gameplay - at least, until we started being able to connect our computers together and to the wider world at large. Since then, we have just been connecting more and more. For anyone who remembers dial-up internet, or even a world without internet (gasp!), this expansion is particularly clear. It seems safe to say that social media is here to stay.

Social media plays an important role in this interconnected world. We see social media every day in our lives: in advertisements, shopping reviews, connecting with professional contacts, and even when we interact digitally with friends. It is all around us. In addition, social media is about more than just &quot;What is my friend Joe up to today?&quot; for most of us. We get information about our real life friends, sure, but we also get information about people we may never have met in real life. We can get feedback on questions, compare reviews on a baseball glove or restaurant, learn about politics and trending stories, and even get help with poor customer service by using social media tools. No business wants to have bad reviews or be on the bad end of a social media rant or video that goes viral.

Our readings this week describe some of the effects social media can have on our mental state and mental health. Have you been considering how you are affected by what you read and view? That is an important life skill to take from this class.

Module 06 - Putting It All Together

We will be reviewing the key ideas for this class in a jeopardy game later in this module, but here is a grand overview.

There are a number of psychological theories that we can use to study the effects of social media. The theories that we looked at include:

- Cultivation theory (exposure changes beliefs over time),
- Social learning theory (we learn from watching others),
- Agenda Setting theory (social media theory tells us what to look at),
- Uses and Gratification Theory (People use social media for different purposes),
- Schemas (categorization strategies)
- Social constructionism (reality varies for each person depending on their experiences)

Social media affects us every day. It affects how we view things, what we view, what we strive for, what we are interested in, who we think of and socialize with people in our lives - our attitudes, behaviors, and even social norms. We can use different theories to examine the relationship more specifically, but we do see the effects in real life. It&#39;s important to note these things and evaluate our biases and those of others as we navigate the social media world.

We learned about identifying with characters from media as well as role-playing games (RPGs) and their impact on social norms. We&#39;ve also talked a lot about stereotypes, cultural issues of race, ethnicity, gender, and social norms in regards to social media. You&#39;ve even seen real life examples of these - remember your social media experiment?

What is the point of businesses setting up and maintaining a social media presence? It&#39;s to make money for their business or brand. One major way of making money is advertising. Ads play a major role in our purchasing habits as well as affecting attitudes, behaviors, and trends. It seems obvious that marketing is important to the success of a brand, but there are more factors involved. Things like stereotypes and following trends and purchasing habits are important to consider as well. We need to be smart media consumers and think about advertisements as we see them.

Violence in social media is a controversial issue, and one that needs a lot more research to unravel. The research thus far is contradicting itself. However, the balance between freedom of speech and postings with violence and aggression is something we&#39;ll likely see more about in the future. Studies on violence in video games and social media are also something that we will see more of.

Social constructionism is using social media and other experiences to create an individual&#39;s view of the world. What we see and what we consume really affects how we see the world. Everyone is a little different, and so everyone&#39;s idea of what the world is really like is a little different as well.

Social media can affect the commission of crimes, possibly making for copycat crimes and suicides. It can also be used to slow or stop these kinds of acts - yet another way that what we click on, view, and talk about is so important!

And last, even our health can be affected by social media - for both better and for worse. A person can find support and ideas to reach their health goals as well as become demoralized and unmotivated by the Pinterest-perfect lives of others.

Now that you&#39;ve seen some of these things, you should be more aware of the social media you are consuming. Thinking critically about what you see and use as well as your biases and reactions to it is an important skill for life.

### **Key Takeaways**

Social media affects us every day. It affects how we view things, what we view, what we strive for, what we are interested in, who we think of and socialize with people in our lives - our attitudes, behaviors, and even social norms. We can use different theories to examine the relationship more specifically, but we do see the effects in real life

We&#39;ve also talked a lot about stereotypes, cultural issues of race, ethnicity, gender, and social norms in regards to social media. Everyone has them, and they affect how we view the world and our other attitudes and behaviors. You&#39;ve even seen real life examples of these!

Advertisements play a major role in our purchasing habits as well as affecting attitudes, behaviors, and trends. Violence is a controversial issue, and one that needs a lot more research to unravel

Social constructionism is using social media and other experiences to create an individual&#39;s view of the world. What we see and what we consume deeply affects how we see the world and what we expect from it

And last, even our health can be affected by social media - for both better and worse There are many important things from this module, but three key points to take away from this week are:

- Our attitudes and behavior are affected by what we do and see, including our social media consumption.
- There are biases and stereotypes in social media that it is important to evaluate as you go.
- Social media affects our lives in many ways - culturally, our view of reality, social trends, crimes, and even our health.

Be a smart consumer and use it wisely!
