Preparing data for Business Intelligence can be a very time-consuming process. While the goal is to provide accurate, strategic reporting, the raw data will need lots of processing before achieving those results. Imagine that you need data from across an organization that provides daily analytics on user behaviors. The data may contain duplications and anomalies that require removal and normalization. This can be a considerable task when data is collected from multiple sources. When data is collected from multiple sources, this can also pose a challenge to the infrastructure by slowing down access.

One example of a data cleansing tool is Tableau Prep. This application allows users to can connect to data, explore, clean, and create an output. Please follow this step-by-step tutorial on how to use Tableau Prep.
