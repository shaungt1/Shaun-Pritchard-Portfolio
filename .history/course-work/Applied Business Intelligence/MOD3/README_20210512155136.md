_Relevance_

• Does it address stakeholders&#39; needs?

_Accuracy_

• If information is inaccurate, then it is not helpful.

_Timeliness_

• Is the information still current?

_Completeness_

• Does the information give the full picture?

_Coherence_

• Does provide relevant details and measurements or are they confusing?

Ensuring data quality requires all dimensions. If one dimension is lacking, then the data is not high quality. For example, if the BI plan requires real-time data up to the minute, but the data source is only valid as of the prior day, then it is poor quality. If the plan requires data from a specific geographical location during 2017, but the only data made available is from the first 6 months, then is not complete. Therefore, any decisions made from this information would be inaccurate.

Ensuring data quality is a challenge. As companies continue to grow and rely on data to make daily decisions, the pressure to produce higher quality data. First, staff need to build trust in BI applications and the underlying data. As mentioned earlier, inaccurate data can lead to false conclusions and poor decisions, or &quot;garbage in, garbage out&quot;.

Companies must establish specific guidelines to ensure that one central repository of data is maintained. If multiple copies begin to scatter throughout, it can lead to expensive analysis and clean up processes, which take time. Time is our fast-moving economy is money.

It is also important to establish uniformity of data. For example, use a standard format of address fields and geographical locations. For example, using abbreviations versus spelling out cities, states, counties, and so on. Otherwise, inconsistencies can lead to unexpected results in queries or building reports using BI applications, such as Tableau. Furthermore, establishing uniformity helps eliminate issues when using multiple data sources in BI applications or trying to get systems to talk to each other.

As market conditions constantly shift or change, companies need the flexibility to quickly adjust. When they cannot, they miss out on business opportunities. Having quality data readily available increases their agility. While companies collect increasingly high volumes of data, strict compliance requirements make it even more important to ensure the integrity. Doing so increases their economic potential.

Consider this 5-component framework of systems:

When it comes to an information system, all 5 components need to interact to produce information. Hardware and software comprise the computer side, while procedures and people make up the human side. Data becomes the bridge between the two. For this system to be effective, all components must work together. With data acting as the bridge, it needs all 5 quality dimensions. Otherwise, the bridge will not be stable. A company can have the most current, high-tech business intelligence application (hardware and software) available, but with poor quality data comes poor decision-making.

An effective BI plan must include clearly defined roles and responsibilities when it comes to the 5 components. When it comes to procedures, best practices should be defined. The BI plan should identify the appropriate technology (hardware and software) to support these procedures. Procedures should be defined according to the company&#39;s mission and strategy.

When identifying roles to ensure data quality, some typical roles are:

- **Data owners:** These individuals define requirements, ensure data quality and accessibility, assign access rights, and authorize stewards to manage data.
- **Data stewards:** These individuals define rules, requirements, coordinate data delivery, and ensure data quality.
- **Data managers:** These individuals implement the requirements of the data owners and manage the technological infrastructure.
- **Data users:** These individuals&#39; access and interpret the data.

Lastly, maintaining data quality is not a one-time process. It is continuous. The process for improving and ensuring high data quality follows a cycle of analyzing, cleansing, and monitoring data quality, covered in the next module.
