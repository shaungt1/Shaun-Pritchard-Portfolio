## Assignments

### Reading -

- [Data science and Big Analytics](http://go.oreilly.com/rasmussen-college/library/view/data-science-and/9781118876138/20_chapter-12.html#c12)
- [Visualizing Data by Ben Fry](http://go.oreilly.com/rasmussen-college/library/view/visualizing-data/9780596514556/bi01.html)

## **Evaluating Data**

Evaluating data is an important first step to better approach any type of analysis. Common things to look for are data types (categorical, numeric, etc.), what is the average for a specific column, what is the mode, the median? What data consists of outliers? These trends are important because it can help determine what type of analysis if any is needed. In industry this is often called a data summary.

## **Visualizations**

Visualization is the next step in an analysis. It&#39;s really an art! Analysts depict the trends outlined above. Picking the correct visualization is important; please review the visualization reading for further details and refer to Edward Tufte for great examples. You will need to define your own style, but these examples will help get you started.

Please Post your Airport presentation, so that other classmates can see it. For this discussion comments will be anonymous. Please watch each of the presentations and provide feedback to your fellow students using the criteria below

| Length | Do you think the Presentation&#39;s Length was fine? Too long, too short? |
| --- | --- |
| Visualizations | Did the visualizations for the data topics make sense? |
| Trends | Did the classmate pick interesting trends? Did those visuals make sense? |
| Organization | Did each slide have an organized layout? If you removed that one slide from the rest of the PPT, would it be able to stand alone? |
| Creativity | Did you find the presentation engaging, on point? |

Due dates for your initial and response posts can be found by checking the **Course Syllabus** and **Course Calendar**.

| **Airport Restaurant Data Presentation** |
| --- |

The CEO is still interested with the Airport Restaurant Data and is asking you to design a presentation on the data, using mostly good visuals. The presentation must include the total number of violations, the most popular violation, the cuisine with the largest number of violations, the total number of restaurants in each airport, and 3 other trends that you find interesting and that should be presented to the board of directors. The CEO has made it very clear that the visuals should be well developed and not overly complicated and the presentation cannot be more than 10 minutes.

**Deliverables**

- **Create** presentation for CEO which should be delivered in a PPT slide deck
- **The CEO is interested in Visualizations**
- **Remember to include 3 other trends that the CEO may find insightful**
- **Present** - Record yourself reviewing the slide deck, explain the visualizations and why you picked them. Review any data issues with the CEO and remember that the presentation should not be more than 10 minutes, the optimal length would be 5-7 minutes, but 10 minutes is the maximum.
