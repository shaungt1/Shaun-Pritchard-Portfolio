# Advanced Analytics Course Overview

![](RackMultipart20201204-4-yqox9_html_237499165a11f2b9.gif)

**Welcome to Advanced Analytics Platforms, Environments, and Software.**

This course focuses on advanced analytics using SAS University Edition. It focuses on developing and deploying Extract Transform Load (ETL) jobs for large data sets. Topics will include how to configure the environment to run the advanced analytic job. The course also focuses on real-time analytics as well. This course will prepare students for developing advanced analytics and ETL jobs. It also prepares students to deploy advanced analytics in the enterprise environment.

We will cover a breadth of related topics, including:

- Real time analytics
- Big data and concept of predictive analytics
- Data extraction process using ETL
- Data modeling and query tuning
- Report generation using SAS
- Advanced analytics execution

A final project is included as a deliverable during this course; as each module is completed, you will perform various steps to resolve the business problem. You will submit a final SAS project during the last module of the course.

Some of the software used in this course is Microsoft only software, therefore if you are using a Macintosh computer you will need to virtualize Windows on your Macintosh computer. You will then be able to run the Microsoft software in the virtualized Windows machine.
