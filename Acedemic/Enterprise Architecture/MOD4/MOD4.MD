**Module 04 - Introduction to Enterprise Architecture and Cloud Services**

This is an overview of the course work I completed for the given topic. Each module contains specific tasks for both a course project and an assignment.

Course is broken down into modules; each folder will be labeled as MOD with the corresponding module number for the term of that specific section of the course work.

Module 04 Lab Assignment - Deploy a PhP Web Application

In this lab, you will deploy your php web application file to an Azure web hosting service. There are many types of services in the Azure cloud system that will host and run a php file. The php web application should be able to connect and process all of the required php code. The web application needs to process basic database functions such as insert, select, update, and delete. Complete each of these deployment objectives and do not skip over other objectives. Make sure that each lab objective is completed in the proper order.

_For help with the following lab objectives refer to_ _ **Lab Appendix H** _.

**Create a new Word lab document for this week&#39;s lab objectives then take screenshots of all your work and paste into the document for submission.**

**Lab Objectives Checklist**

- Create a cloud service FTP connection.
- Add a user account and password credentials to the FTP connection.
- Authenticate to a cloud FTP connection.
- Connect to the FTP Web App service with a File Explorer window.
- Transfer a php file to the Web App service using the FTP connection.
- Preview the php web application is working in a web browser.
- Perform basic database functions from the web application.
- Verify that the database activity worked properly.
- Create a user testing script.
- **Submit the snapshots of your work to the course Dropbox for grading.**

Module 04 Course Project - Implementation Documentation

In this project phase the assigned team of developers begin to build the product as it was designed in the use case documentation. The project manager works through the project gathering requirements for this phase.

At this point in the project process, the project manager should have acquired all of the details needed for the developer to build the product. It is critical for the project to begin this phase on time so all managers can start to see their investment.

**Project Objectives Checklist**

- Document the developer testing environment
- Document the user acceptance testing environment
- Document a four week project schedule
- Identify WBS items within the project schedule
- Identify project user roles and purpose

Your object is to update the Use-Case documentation with the following project execution and testing phase objectives:

1. There are two common testing environments that most developers will have experience working in. The developer workstation is considered one type of testing environment. The User Acceptance Testing (UAT) environment lets the users test the product or a change within a system that is a replica of production. The developer typically moves any software code and/or files to this system for each product change. Design a documented procedure for a developer to follow when pushing a product change from the developer testing environment to a UAT testing system for the users to preview and test.
2. A project schedule gives everyone on the project an idea of when the work breakdown structure tasks should be completed by. During the execution phase, everyone on the team works on each of the WBS items as they are documented. The schedule has many other purposes for the project manager that helps them determine timelines, expectations, and other project details. Design a four week project schedule showing all of the objectives that should be completed within each week and identify how long it will take for each task.
3. Everyone who is involved in a project has a specific role and purpose they perform and contribute to the project. Identify each person involved in the course project, describe their role, and provide details about what they will contribute to the project. Assume again that this task is about the course lab application that you are currently developing. Think about everyone involved with helping you from the beginning to the end of the course lab assignments. Keep in mind that you did not create your student cloud account by yourself; someone was involved and helped you create that account.
