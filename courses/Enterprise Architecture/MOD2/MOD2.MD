**Module 02 - Introduction to Enterprise Architecture and Cloud Services**

This is an overview of the course work I completed for the given topic. Each module contains specific tasks for both a course project and an assignment.

Course is broken down into modules; each folder will be labeled as MOD with the corresponding module number for the term of that specific section of the course work.

Module 02 Lab Assignment - Setup Cloud Database Data

In this lab, you will be required to build a new database table. The table will eventually be used with a web-based application to load new records into the table and then finally display those records back into the web application. Database tables are created with SQL commands or using database management tools that help build the tables.

**PhpMyAdmin** is a **database management tool** that works well with a MySQL database. This tool is a **web-based client** that connects to a database and lets the user manage an existing database or build new databases. The tool also lets the user build new tables and manage the **table data** (also known as **records** ). If you have previous experience with other databases or Microsoft Excel you will easily understand database and table concepts.

_For help with the following lab objectives refer to_ _ **Lab Appendix B and C** _.

**Create a new Word lab document for this week&#39;s lab objectives then take screenshots of all your work and paste into the document for submission.**

**Lab Objectives Checklist**

1. Login to student cloud portal system.
2. Login to phpMyAdmin web client management tool.
3. Create a new database table.
4. Run SQL insert commands.
5. Run SQL update commands.
6. Run SQL select commands.
7. Run SQL delete commands.
8. **Submit the snapshots of your work to the course Dropbox for grading.**

**Project Objectives Checklist**

1. Familiarize yourself with the analysis documentation phase.
2. Identify Business rules.
3. Define Software and System Requirements.
4. Prioritize Requirements.
5. Submit the module use-case document to the course Dropbox for grading.

The purpose of this project phase is meant to obtain system and software requirements. These types of details are needed to show project costs and identify project resources.

Sometimes a prototype is designed and developed during this phase but it is not always required. _A prototype is a mockup of the project or a sample of the product and a mockup will not be required for this assignment_.

Your object is to learn how the analysis phase documentation affects the project plan. There a several components of this phase but you will only work with a couple components.

**In this documentation component, you will write several business rules.**

1. Create another new paragraph in the Use-Case document started in the previous module that contains the business rules. _A business rule is meant to help everyone understand the logic of each area of the service or product that is being developed._

With a software application, a common business rule can be something validates user input controls. The business rules are regulated at the user interface and in the business logic layer of the source code. Depending on the complexity of the application source code, the business logic layer is managed within the syntax of the source code. Write several business rules that are applied to this web application for capturing form information into the database table columns First\_Name, Last\_Name and Telephone number.
2.
**In this documentation component you will write the software and system requirements.** Create another new paragraph with a heading that contains the system and software features. A software or system requirement is an item that describes a functional or non-functional requirement that gives the project development a purpose. A requirement can also be a user experience or interaction with the application. Write and describe several application requirements that users would experience or expect while using an application.
3.
**In this component of the use-case documentation you will prioritize the requirements from most importance to least.**
The priority of the requirements is important that they are placed in the right order. If a requirement is not prioritized properly, that requirement might not be developed correctly. Other risks can cause the project to fail or a developer might need to redo work that would change project timelines and increase project costs.Create another section that prioritizes all of the project requirements from most important to least importance.
