**Module 03 - Introduction to Enterprise Architecture and Cloud Services**

This is an overview of the course work I completed for the given topic. Each module contains specific tasks for both a course project and an assignment.

Course is broken down into modules; each folder will be labeled as MOD with the corresponding module number for the term of that specific section of the course work.

Module 03 Lab Assignment - Build a PhP Web Application Form

The purpose of this assignment is to build a new php web application form that will connect to the MySQL database hosted on the cloud system. This form will do many of the basic web application form activities such as insert and read data from a database. A web page does not always have to perform database activity. If you need a web page the can send out a message and that is it&#39;s only purpose then you have met your purpose. In this course, we will build more than just a simple web page with a message.

_ **NOTE** _ _- Each of__the following lab objectives has individual lab appendix references._

**Create a new Word lab document for this week&#39;s lab objectives then take screenshots of all your work and paste into the document for submission.**

**Lab Objectives Checklist**

1. Create a new web page file.
2. Write basic HTML5 tags to build the web page.
3. Build an HTML5 web page form.
4. Get all of the connection string details from the database service.
5. Write php code to build the connection to the database service.
6. Write php code to insert new records into the database.
7. Write php code to get records and display back into the web page.
8. Write CSS3 to format the web page.
9. **Submit the snapshots of your work to the course Dropbox for grading.**

Module 03 Course Project - Design Documentation

**Project Objectives Checklist**

1. Understand the design documentation phase
2. Document several cloud services needed for this project
3. Create a flow chart of the course lab application
4. Implement a historical change grid at the top of the document
5. Submit the module use-case document to the course Dropbox for grading

The project design phase begins with opening the discussions into more details about the project requirements. The details can cover the user interface look and feel to how each of the controls will be used and what type of permissions are applied to each user control. During this phase, it is critical for the system/network administrators and database admins to step in and contribute to these discussions. The design of these system components are important and they will have a direct effect on the performance of the product or service.

1. In this objective imagine that you are a system/network engineer and document some of the common cloud services to implement a software application product built in-house as an enterprise product that must supports 100 simultaneous users. Make sure to document why you need the cloud service for this type of enterprise solution and then document the benefits of using the cloud service for each component that you recommended.
2. In this step design and build a new flow-chart of current course lab application. You will be far enough into the course lab that you will be able to build a flow-chart from it. Use whatever tools are at your disposal from Microsoft Paint to Visio or hand draw a design and take a picture of it with your phone. Flow charts give the reader a visual understanding of the project design and the user responds to different scenarios while using the product.
3. At the top of this document, implement historical changes grid so all readers know when a section in the use case was changed, and by whom. The historical change section should be easy to understand why a change to the document occurred, with informative details such as name, change description, date of change, and version. In a way, this is used for document control, there are other ways to manage document changes but they do not keep track of the history of each change, sometimes this is a manual process.
