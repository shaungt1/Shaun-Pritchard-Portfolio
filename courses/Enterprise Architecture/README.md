### **Course Project Introduction**

**Project Overview**

This course project will help you learn the knowledge and skills necessary to build a web-based application. The cloud system will be setup to support several services such as Bitnami (LAMP) and a MySQL database. The web application will also support a functioning interface to the backend database that will perform basic database functions. Throughout the scope of the entire course, you will create a product and setup services to support a small to medium size enterprise business that you could use in the real world.

**Due Date**

The entire course project is due in Module 06. There are assignments for the project in each module. Your instructor will list the dues dates for these assignments on the **Course Calendar**.
