**Module 01 - Introduction to Enterprise Architecture and Cloud Services**

This is an overview of the course work I completed for the given topic. Each module contains specific tasks for both a course project and an assignment.

Course is broken down into modules; each folder will be labeled as MOD with the corresponding module number for the term of that specific section of the course work.

Module 01 Lab Assignment - Create Cloud Enterprise Services

In this lab, you will setup the developer tools and environments that will help you succeed throughout this course. There will be web based cloud services and tools used which are accessed through an Internet browser. You will not need to install any additional software to complete any of the lab objectives.

Begin the module objectives for this week&#39;s lab work by logging into your student Azure portal account. User credential information to the student Azure portal system should have been given to you via your student email account. If you are experiencing any login issues or you have not received that information then immediately contact your course instructor.

Each lab section has a specific appendix listed as a help reference. It is highly recommended to save a copy of the **Lab Appendixes** file to your computer.

_For help with the following lab objectives refer to_ _ **Lab Appendix A** _.

Create a new lab file in Microsoft Word for this week&#39;s lab objectives then take screenshots of all your work to be pasted in the document for submission. This will be the method of submission for **all** of your **lab assignments** in this course.

**Lab Objectives Checklist**

1. Login to student cloud portal system.
2. Create a new Web App + MySQL service.
3. Create a new MySQL database service.
4. Create a new Web App service connection string.
5. Create a new Web App service phpMyAdmin extension.
6. Login to the new phpMyAdmin web app.
7. **Submit the snapshots of your work in a Microsoft Word file to the course Dropbox for grading.**

**Objective #1 Setup Cloud Web App Service w/MySQL**

Using your cloud student account login to the portal system and add a new &quot;Web App + MySQL service&quot;. This service is different from the normal &quot;Web App&quot; service since it contains MySQL software that is automatically installed with your Web App service. **Do not install a normal &quot;Web App&quot; service and assume it will work with a MySQL database.**

**Objective #2 Setup Cloud New MySQL Database Service**

While logged into your cloud student account, search and install a new &quot;MySQL&quot; database service. During the process of creating the new database service, select a pricing tier with the absolute lowest cost. This database service will eventually work parallel with the new Web App service.

In the MySQL database service, go to the **Properties** option and get a copy of the connection string. Then go to the new **Web App service w/MySQL** then select the **Application Settings** option. Create a new connection string with the connection string information from the MySQL database. This new connection string if setup correction will allow the Web App service to directly work with the new MySQL database service.

1. During the create process, give the database service a unique database name since this name will also appear in your database management tools.

**Objective #3 Setup phpMyAdmin Web Client**

Go to the Web App service and then select the extensions option and install a new extension service called &quot;phpMyAdmin&quot;. Wait a couple minutes until the service installs, try to avoid leaving the service or clicking around while the extension is installing. Once the extension is installed, it will appear as a new tool in the Web App service extensions. The phpMyAdmin extension is meant as a database management tool to manage the new MySQL database service. Without this tool, it will be very difficult to manage the database service and create new tables or creating new records.

1. While in the Web App service, make sure you are in the extensions option and click on the new phpMyAdmin extension tool.
2. Click the **Browse Menu** option; you should see your new database that was created earlier.

Submit your completed assignment by following the directions linked below. Please check the **Course Calendar** for specific due dates.

Save your assignment as a Microsoft Word document. (Mac users, please remember to append the &quot;.docx&quot; extension to the filename.) The name of the file should be your first initial and last name, followed by an underscore and the name of the assignment, and an underscore and the date. An example is shown below:

Module 01 Course Project - Preparing Project Documentation

**Project Objectives Checklist**

1. Familiarize yourself with the planning documentation phase.
2. Create a new project use-case file.
3. Give the project an appropriate name.
4. Write a project summary.
5. Write a project schedule that contains timelines and project tasks.
6. Write and identify project risks.
7. **Submit the module use-case document to the course Dropbox for grading.**

The project planning phase is devoted to identifying and documenting the **project purpose** , the **scope of the project** , a **schedule with timelines** , **risks and project milestones**. These project requirements are about you working on and building a **new use-case document**.

The project is an individual who takes the lead with this document and works with all the users and Subject Matter Experts (SME) to fulfill the documents requirements. Your objective is to learn the basics of how to build a use-case document, which can be used for any type of Information Technology (IT) project such as software development enhancements or infrastructure implementation projects and infrastructure enhancements.

1. Begin by creating **a new Microsoft Word document** and saving it to your hard drive somewhere. Give the document a name, typically the document would represent a project number and/or a project name. Use the naming standards that you would find on the Internet or commonly used for business purposes, name the file appropriately.
  1. There are several project components used for creating the requirements documentation. In this assignment, you will only document a couple of these components such as risks and analysis.
2. At the beginning of the use-case document **create a project summary**. The summary is a paragraph that describes the project and the purpose of the project. Make sure the summary clearly describes the project, so anyone who reads this document will understand its purpose. There should be enough details so the reader does not have any questions about the projects purpose.
3. **Create a project schedule** that contains a six-week plan of what you would want to accomplish during the six weeks. Since this course moves quickly, make sure that you identify each weekly set of goals with enough objectives so you are successful. Estimate each week&#39;s objectives with tasks to do for each module. Make the schedule in a **Microsoft Excel spreadsheet** with a header row that is clear and precise. The spreadsheet will help keep the schedule organized. **Copy and paste the schedule into your use-case document (the Word file).**
4. Develop another paragraph to document the projects risks. The risks can be anything that would threaten the project&#39;s success. Document as many risks necessary and consider risks for **software requirements** , **hardware requirements** , **staffing** , **timelines** , and **project costs**.
