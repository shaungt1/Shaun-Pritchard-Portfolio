**SAS Scripting MOD5**

This is an overview of the course work I completed for the given topic. Each module contains specific tasks for both a course project and an assignment.

Course is broken down into modules; each folder will be labeled as MOD with the corresponding module number for the term of that specific section of the course work.

_Each module folder will have the lesson content I learned and tasks for the assignments and projects I completed._
