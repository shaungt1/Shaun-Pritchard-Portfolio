Module 01 - SAS Environment Setup and Configuration

**Project Overview**

You are working as an Analytics Developer for Apex Corp, which is a retail firm similar to Walmart. In this project, you will need to predict store sales based on the historical data. It will help your company order the inventory for next year. Your script output will be presented as a custom report to each store manager. It will help the retail firm to increase their profit as well because your script will help them to stock only those items that are in demand.

You need to use the SAS University Edition tool and generate SAS scripts. Your project must include following things:

- SAS Scripts
- Sales projection prediction
- Apply scripting standard
- Test SAS script

All work must be original. Include comments throughout your code.

In addition to the above requirements, you will be expected to submit SAS scripts that:

- Run and operate without error.
- Are clearly written and readable with clear and sufficient comments.
