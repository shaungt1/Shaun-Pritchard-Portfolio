# Welcome to my portfolio!

### Developer: Shaun Pritchard
This is a unique approach that I've not seen very many other do; at least to this extent? I will be listing projects and developments I want ti highlight in my portfolio. Also, I will be hosting the academic coursework, classes, proofs, scientific work, and postulates I have taken, worked on, and completed. I hope to show the comprehension and diversity of my skill sets and knowledge base. While openly making my work available for others to engage and interact with. I will be using a tree traversal categorization.
