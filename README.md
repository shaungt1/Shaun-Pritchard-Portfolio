# Shaun Pritchards Portfolio
This repo is a collective I am using to highlight, show my skillsets, and progresive knowledge based on my work.


The idea is to host all my projects, class, development, math, and science work to make a knowledge base containing the work I have done.

I will make an interactive interface using Github pages to highlight specific knowledge, work and technologies. Located here
