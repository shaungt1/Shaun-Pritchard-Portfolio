# Welcome to my portfolio!

### Developer: Shaun Pritchard
TThis portfolio is a unique approach that I've not seen very many others do, at least to this extent? I will be listing project developments and much more.  Also, I will be hosting the academic coursework, classes, proofs, scientific work, and postulates I have taken, worked on, and completed at my university.  I will also host my course work takes from virtual correspondence courses online. I hope to show the comprehension and diversity of my skill sets and knowledge base. While openly making my work available for others to engage and interact. I will be using a tree traversal categorization.
