# Welcome to my portfolio!

### Developer: Shaun Pritchard
This is a unique approach that I've not seen anyone else do to this extent. Not only will I be listing projects and developments I have created or worked on. I will be hosting the coursework, classes, proofs, scientific work, and postulates I have taken, worked on, and completed. I hope to show the comprehension and diversity of my skill sets and knowledge base. While openly making my work available for others to engage and interact with. I will be using a tree traversal categorization.

*If you are an employer or are seeking to utilize my skill sets please contact me at: shaun@webreactor.com*

# About Myself: 

Currently, I'm a student, Inventor, author, disabled veteran, and entrepreneur working toward my (MCS) Master's in Data Science. After, which I will pursue my Ph.D. in quantum computational mathematics. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Data Analytics. I'm located in Tampa Florida, I have authored 2 books, developed Web, native, and IoT applications. I have helped work on some prestigious developments and internships (Listed in my resume). I have a passion for data, science, math, programming, and physics. Especially, quantum physics and quantum computational mathematics. My goal is to work on fault tolerance systems for quantum reversible circuits. I love to read, play guitar, and surf. I like to create content and teach others the things I have learned. I like to help people and help simplify the complexity of abstract topics to make them easy to understand.

# Main Categories
### These are the categories that will encompass my work. Within each main category, the categories for work, skillsets, and projects reside. All of these projects are based in Computer Science, Programming, Data Science, AI, Mathematics, & Quantum Computation and other related skillsets. 

* ## Classes
* ## Projects
* ## Books
* ## Apps
* ## Business
* ## Design

#  Contents of Each Main Category:
### Each category within the main class category will contian heterogeneous sub categories for particular subjects they realte to.

## Classes

>The Classes section gives me a way to publish my course work and highlight my achivments, proofs, problems, and understadning of specific topics. All Proofs are written to spcified guildines and methods that implement contridiction, well ordering and logical proposition principles. All papers, articles, and thessis are written in APA format. All Programs where written with VS Code, PyScripter, Jupyter Notbook, Octave, and other text editors openly aviable.
