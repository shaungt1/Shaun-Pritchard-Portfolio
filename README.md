## Interactive Web Applciation

GitHub is a great place for professionals to showcase their work, but I want to do something more unique and go beyond just generating a static website with basic links to my projects. I wanted to build an interactive environment to showcase my work. You can visit my interactive web application.

My interactive web app is more of a pipeline and data science lab uses a SPA with custom APIs that I developed that connects to my development servers, pipelines, and distributed network across K8 clusters.

To showcase my understanding and diversity of my skill sets and knowledge base, I also wanted to host my coursework thesis, research, and algorithms while openly making my work available for others to engage and interact with.

Note: Please check below to see if my interactive web app / dev-lab is up. I am constantly updating and adding new code and features.

***Please visit my interactive React web application portfolio here:***

## Design UX/UI
> I consider myself to be a creative individual and have been for years. Since graduating from Tampa Tech with an AA in graphic arts in 2000, I've pursued design work and educated myself on UX/UI design principles. In my opinion, they are crucial to the development of any product. The following are several of my personal Figma UX/UI designs for professional and personal projects I have contributed to and designed.
