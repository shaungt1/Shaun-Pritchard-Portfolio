# Welcome to my portfolio!

### Developer: Shaun Pritchard
This is a unique approach that I've not seen anyone else do to this extent. Not only will I be listing projects and developments I have created or worked on. I will be hosting the coursework, classes, proofs, scientific work, and postulates I have taken, worked on, and completed. I hope to show the comprehension and diversity of my skill sets and knowledge base. While openly making my work available for others to engage and interact with.

After, which I will pursue my Ph.D. in quantum computational mathematics. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Data Analytics. I'm located in Tampa Florida, I have authored 2 books, developed Web, native, and IoT applications. I have helped work on some prestigious developments and internships (Listed in my resume). I have a passion for data, science, math, programming, and physics. Especially, quantum physics and quantum computational mathematics. My goal is to work on fault tolerance systems for quantum reversible circuits. I love to read, play guitar, and surf. I like to create content and teach others the things I have learned. I like to help people and help simplify the complexity of abstract topics to make them easy to understand.
