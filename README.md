# Welcome to my portfolio!

### Senior Software Engineer / A.I Data Scientist: Shaun Pritchard
In my experience, this is a very unique approach that I haven't seen many others use, at least to this extent.

The portfolio contains all of my programming, math, and science accomplishments including code projects, database architecture, published research, graphic design, video production, AI models, and implementations involving my skills in full-stack development, data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning engineering.

GitHub is a great place for professionals to showcase their work, but I want to do something more unique and go beyond just generating a static website with basic links to my projects. I wanted to build an interactive environment to showcase my work.

My interactive development and data science lab uses a SPA with custom APIs that I developed that connects to my development servers, pipelines, and distributed network across K8 clusters.

To showcase my understanding and diversity of my skill sets and knowledge base, I also wanted to host my coursework thesis while openly making my work available for others to engage and interact with.
