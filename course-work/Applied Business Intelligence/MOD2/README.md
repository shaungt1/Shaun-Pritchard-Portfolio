**Information Gathering**
When creating a business intelligence plan, the goal may be to build a system that focuses on answering basic questions on how a company does business. The best practice is to start off small, then build on those questions once you become more comfortable with analyzing the data. For example, below are some basic questions you might ask about a business:

- How many employees are currently active?
- Who are the top 10 or 20 clients or customers?
- What is the monetary value of the top 10 client contracts?
- What geographic region(s) attract the most business?

Without some type of business intelligence system, managers would have a difficult time answering these questions. Business intelligence helps managers think of new ways to do business on a more continual basis. For example, once they can determine the top 20 clients, they can begin identifying specific metrics needed to gather additional data. The business intelligence plan should outline.

- The datasets that should be collected and measured.
- The methods used to collect data.
- The processes to conduct the measurements
- Quality assurance of the data.
- The methods used to distribute data.
- The methods used to quickly disseminate reports.

There are several popular business intelligence applications, such as Tableau, that provide automation of the tasks mentioned above. The key to successful implementation would be input from stakeholders and individuals with an expertise in BI.

 To benefit the most from BI, the planning must evolve from improved business processes and assessment. This helps managers determine information requirements to help address business needs and identify success criteria.

 Some companies view their data as a corporate asset. We experience this all the time, whether we realize it or not, when it comes to our online browsing habits, shopping habits, cell phone usage, and so on. They now must ensure that data is properly collected, aggregated, and analyzed, because it can open the doors to new opportunities, which will be discussed in a later module.

**Decision Making**
When you think of business processes, there is always some type of information being collected and manipulated. Then results are somehow presented to help executives and managers make decisions. Some decisions are major ones, where they drive organizational strategies, while others may relate to operational or day to day activities. For example, when an order process is broken down into steps, every step has some value added to the order delivery process. Each step can also be measured in terms of performance. Decisions made to lead to the best performance benefit the overall process.

 However, there may be times when decision-makers cannot make the best decisions because they do not have the information they need in real-time. These individuals do not only need more information. They need information presented in a way where specific or key points required to make the best decisions are highlighted so that they can quickly act.

 Aside from timeliness of information, there are several other **dimensions of information quality** :

_Relevance_
• Does it address stakeholders&#39; needs?
_Accuracy_
 • If information is inaccurate, then it is not helpful.
_Timeliness_
 • Is the information still current?
_Completeness_
 • Does the information give the full picture?
_Coherence_
 • Does provide relevant details and measurements Or are they confusing?


 From a strategic perspective, senior managers can review company performance to consider alternate strategies. When it comes to operational activities, key pieces of intelligence may be presented in real-time. Managers can adjust business processes by tracking key performance indicators (KPI). Key performance indicators help managers define and measure progress towards the company or organization&#39;s goals.
