t is one thing to have abundantly available raw data, and the ability to build various types of data visualizations. However, just having data and visualizations is not enough. The key is the ability to convert the data into actionable intelligence or Business Intelligence. When data is turned into actual intelligence, it can then be used to make proactive decisions and create opportunities. Once opportunities have been identified, executives and managers can use this knowledge to make changes to daily business decisions on strategic and operational levels. In turn, this helps the company get closer to achieving organizational goals. The illustration below illustrates the steps for turning data into business opportunities.

- When you are trying to identify an opportunity, try to find a specific problem or challenge. Once you have identified the specific problem or challenge, you can then begin creating a plan for collecting data. You must begin to list specific types of data that support your idea. Try to be as thorough as possible when you create this list. Sometimes, ideas will come to you during your research and you&#39;ll need to add to the list. You may also uncover data that you were not aware existed but supports your theory.
- Once you have identified the data you require, you need a way to collect it. There are numerous repositories of open source data available online. It can be overwhelming trying to select the best source. Make sure you research the data repository to make sure the data meets the 5 dimensions discussed in Module 03:

_Relevance_

• Does it address stakeholders&#39; needs?

_Accuracy_

• If information is inaccurate, then it is not helpful.

_Timeliness_

• Is the information still current?

_Completeness_

• Does the information give the full picture?

_Coherence_

• Does provide relevant details and measurements or are they confusing?

- Determine which processes can be improved upon and capture data after those changes have been implemented. Try to identify trends over specific periods of time. To do this, you should analyze and manipulate the data to make future projections.
- Based on the identified trends, you should then be able to test your initial theory or determine if the result is different than what you expected. Perhaps you&#39;ll uncover a new theory or idea.
- Strengthen your case by building data visualizations that illustrate what-if scenarios. Use these visualizations to tell stakeholders a story that helps their decision-making process.
