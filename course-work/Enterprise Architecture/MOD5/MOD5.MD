**Module 05 - Introduction to Enterprise Architecture and Cloud Services**

This is an overview of the course work I completed for the given topic. Each module contains specific tasks for both a course project and an assignment.

Course is broken down into modules; each folder will be labeled as MOD with the corresponding module number for the term of that specific section of the course work.

n this lab, you will begin learning how to query the data and return specific results. In an enterprise environment, the queries can be easy or complicated depending on the complexity of the database architecture. The course database is not complicated and you will use the same database that you built in a previous week.

In addition to writing basic SQL database queries, you will also test your web application within a device simulator. This module lab will require a Google Chrome browser.

_For help with the following lab objectives refer to_ _ **Lab Appendix I** __._

**Create a new Word lab document for this week&#39;s lab objectives then take screenshots of all your work and paste into the document for submission.**

**Lab Objectives Checklist**

- Create new web application records.
- Test the web application from a device simulator.
- Access the cloud phpMyAdmin web client.
- Change devices within the simulator.
- View the records stored on the MySQL database.
- **Submit the snapshots of your work to the course Dropbox for grading.**

**Project Objectives Checklist**

- Document the definition of scope creep
- Describe the effects of scope creep
- Create a baseline spreadsheet of information
- Document the purpose of a kickoff meeting

During the maintenance phase, all issues that were identified as a change request from the User Acceptance Testing cycles or any other missing features that were never implemented are finally built into production during this phase. The maintenance phase is a long-term commitment to the future enhancements and system bug fixes for the remaining life cycle of the product or service.

Your objective is to update the **Use-Case documentation** with the following project maintenance phase tasks:

1. **Identify the meaning of scope creep and how scope creep affects a project.** Describe a couple of topics that you can think of such as timelines and budget (just to mention a few) that would have a direct impact on a project. Scope creep is a serious issue with all project managers.
2. **Create a baseline of metrics that can be used to measure the performance of a software application.** This type of information should be formatted so that it is easy to read. Organize a set of metric data that you would expect to monitor over a given duration of time. An example of performance metrics would be Date/Time stamp, bandwidth, CPU, and RAM resources. Set up a small grid of statistical information and then measure it again in a couple days while the product is running on your localhost machine or within a simulator.
3. **Describe the purpose of a project kickoff meeting and identify several meeting components that are critical to the success of the meeting.** Most projects have a meeting at the beginning and the end of the project. Projects that require a project manager will have a significant value to the company. A kickoff meeting sets the tone of the project. During this meeting, each role is identified. Everyone who will contribute to the project needs to attend this meeting so they understand the chain of command and what they need to do.
