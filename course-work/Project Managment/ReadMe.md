# **Business Project Management**

This is a 5 module that I took while building a course project thesis, research, analysis, and proofs papers for each module the final summarize thesis Project managements for a real world application. You can review the work that I have completed below and read my thesis. Please feel free to message me about any of the topics listed or open the discussion about the topics being discussed.

**Business Project Management**

Throughout this course you will explore and examine the various facets involved in managing projects in business. Project management involves the process of guiding a project from its beginning through its performance all the way to its closure. This course will discuss the basic principles of project management and the role of the Project Manager. You will discover tracking tools and techniques used in project management along with scope management, managing risk, project scheduling, project evaluation, control and closeout as well as the importance of team building. As you progress through this course, it will become apparent that project management differs from general management. The focus in project management is only on the project and its tasks as well as keeping on track and on time.

Let&#39;s begin our exploration of project management.

# **Foundational Standards of Project Management**

The four areas of the project management profession that define the foundational standards are: Project, Program, Portfolio, and the organizational approach to project management. The areas listed above provide the foundation on which industry standards are built and measured when utilizing the project management knowledge. The relationship between portfolios, programs and projects is one where specific programs and projects are assigned and managed by an operational structure working to achieve a specific objective. The objective is organization specific with on-time completion and profitability in mind.

Individual projects are part of programs which in turn make up an organizations portfolio. The projects and programs may either be related or not. The one similarity is that each and every project and program is linked to the organization by the organization&#39;s strategic plan (see the figure below).

(from PMBOK Guide, 5th ed., p. 5)

Organizations develop, plan, and accept specific projects and programs based on specific factors such as:

- Risk
- Funding
- Available resources
- Knowledge base

These factors vary from organization to organization impacting how an organization develops and builds its program portfolio.

# **Understanding Organizational Project Management (OPM)**

As defined by the Project Management Body of Knowledge:

[Organizational Project Management (OPM)](http://www.projectmanagement.com/pages/290078/What-is-Organizational-Project-Management-) is a strategy execution framework utilizing project, program, and portfolio management as well as organizational enabling practices to consistently and predictably deliver organizational strategy producing better performance, better results, and a sustainable competitive advantage.

What does this mean?! Portfolios, Programs and Projects are aligned and driven by the specific strategies of an organization. Organizations will only take on specific programs or projects if they meet the organizations current needs and goals. Not to say an organization has never taken a project on if it did not align with the organizations current business strategy. In general, an organization will only accept a program or project that meets its current business plan, will strengthen its program portfolio and help achieve strategic goals.

Project management creates and implements plans to manage specific project scope that is driven by the organizations objectives. Along with organizational project management linking each project and program in various supporting functions, combining both areas of expertise provides the organizations with an added assurance of program success and portfolio support.

# **Conclusion**

Organizations across various industries are realizing the benefits and value of successful project management. Foundational standards define an organization&#39;s goals and objectives year after year. How an organization utilizes and manages its functional resources plays a significant part in the organization&#39;s ongoing success. Project management utilizes industry standard tools and techniques in managing specific projects and programs that ultimately make up the organization&#39;s portfolio. Understanding the interaction of project management, organizational project management and foundational standards assist in the success of any organization.
