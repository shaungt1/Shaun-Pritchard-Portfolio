1.	June 15,2016, the U.S Army contacted us with the material recommendation change that will effectively make the backpacks from Kevlar bulletproof material. we will need the design team and research development to coordinate and efforts to find the correct material specification for production that can be used in a proprietary backpack with a refrigeration pouch and radio module that can resist enemy attacks of bullet rounds. We will need management teams to find reliable Kevlar vendors and use document procedures to estimate and recalculate deliverables, schedule, parts, resources, and materials need to work with this material. As to my knowledge there is only one manufacture of the material who creates Kevlar 29 and Kevlar 49, but please reaffirm this and check for sub vendors and direct cost associated with the material (Dupont, 2020).The client has also insinuated a budget increase, but no final budget numbers are known yet. We will have to work within the parameters of the current budget to facilitate the change of material and final output of the product and reallocate cost to meet the demand.
