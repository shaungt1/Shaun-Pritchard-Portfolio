**SAS Environment Setup**

**To complete the work in this course, you will need to set up a SAS Environment. It will allow you to follow things.**

- **Write SAS program**
- **Debug SAS program**
- **Access raw data file**
- **Product analytics results**
- **Build custom reports**

**Please download this** [**file**](https://content.learntoday.info/Learn/QMB4200Cfw_Winter_18/Media/sas_setup.pdf) **for step-by-step instructions on how to setup your SAS environment.**

### **Real-time Analytics**

**Real-time Analytics**

**Tesla company manufactures several types of electric car. Tesla collects data for every single car and runs various types of analytics on the data. They do provide a lot of recommendations based on the analytics output. There are a lot of situations where we need to analyze the real-time data and make decisions. For example, if your car&#39;s brake pads are not working properly. Here is the step by step events that can save your life.**

**Step 1: Your car is sending the data for each car parts to the data center.**

**Step 2: Car company is collecting the data and running real-time analytics on it.**

**Step 3: Car company&#39;s analytics predict a possible failure in brake pad and raise the alert**

**Step 4: You will get notified via text message or any notification services regarding the possible failure.**

**Step 5: You stop your car immediately and visit the repair center**

**Here are some of the components that will be useful for real-time analytics.**

**Event Hub: It is an ingestion service that collects, transforms and stores millions of events.**

**Stream Analytics: It connects to the external data sources (Event hub) and update the external database or raise an event based on proposed information**

**Notification Services: It is simply a service that is used to either raise an alert or provide notification via email or text message.**

**Course Project Introduction**

**Project Overview**

**You are working as an analytics Developer for a state government of Maryland, and you need to predict police officer recruiting based on the historical crime data.

It will help the state government to hire police officers in the area where crime rates are high.**

**You need to use SAS University Edition tool and generate a SAS scripts. Your project must include following things.**

- **Test SAS script**
- **It must be original work and include comments throughout your code.**

**In addition to the above requirements, you will be expected to submit SAS scripts that:**
