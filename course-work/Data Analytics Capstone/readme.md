# **Welcome to Data Analytics Capstone.**

# Congratulations! You have finally arrived at your final data analytics destination, the Data Analytics Capstone. Now is the time for you to show what you know and show what you can do when it comes to creating a data analytics solution.

# In the present time and on into the future, businesses need to know the status of their internal operations. A good handle on what is happening within their market is also important; this is especially true when considering the competition. There is an abundance of internal and external data at their disposal that data analytics can extract and make useful; this process can readily convert, shape, and model the data to draw inferences and recognize patterns. The generation of internal data from every organization is free for the taking; the majority of the external data provided by the government and other agencies is also mostly free. If an organization adopts the use of data analytics, they can operate more efficiently and take advantage of hidden opportunities that their competition might overlook. Most companies are aware of the importance of data analytics and what they can do for their bottom line. However, very few are taking full advantage and are making important decisions through guesswork. Learning all about identifying and analyzing data will make you an important asset when your organization begins to use of data analytics.

# In the first module you will explain the different operations of each department and Develop a flow chart showing how each is related to the other. In Modules 02-04 you will be introduced to separate business cases that will be tied together in Module 05. You will analyze each of these three modules and generate reports and visualizations. This three-case collection will become the platform for your course project. Your project will contain departmental relationships that you will analyze and for which you will create a visual presentation explaining how to strengthen the company&#39;s overall efficiency and profitability. By using your analysis, you will make suggestions on how each of the three departments can improve their operations. You will demonstrate how your suggestions will improve the company&#39;s efficiencies, and if implemented, how they will lead to an increase in the bottom-line.

# This course will guide you through the development process week by week. Stay on top of your project course requirements and make sure you do not fall behind. This course will go quickly and, before you know it, your project will be due.

# You will learn how to work and analyze data sets, analyze as well as create effective data visualizations. The tools you will use to analyze data and create data visualizations will be Tableau Desktop, Professional Edition, Ver. 10 or SAS University Edition. This software is free for download to students enrolled in this course. You will also take a look at other analytical tools to get an idea of what other offerings are available. As you progress through this course, you will also learn how to apply editorial thinking and communications to your presentations. Through analysis of the visualizations that you will create, you will learn how to identify insights and apply them to various business problems. Insight identification is important especially insights that are actionable.

Modules 02-04 will consist of business cases that you will analyze to create reports and visualizations. Module 05 will allow you to bring the preceding modules together to form your final project

Uploading to GitHub is not required for this course, but you will be given information on how to do it if you have not had the experience before. By uploading your final project to a repository, you can share your work with others worldwide, including potential employers!
