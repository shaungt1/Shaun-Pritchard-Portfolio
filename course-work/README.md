# Welcome to the Design Section

>  In this section I'll be hosting my graphic, web, and video design projects, VFX, animations, Code based graphics and physics engines (Three.js, Animie.js, etc..) and other artwork that I have designed, built, or have drawn over the years. I started out as a graphic designer what's an associate's degree from Tampa Technical Institute. I have helped created popular brand logos for many businesses including Enterprise companies. Being creative is just something I love to do and I'd like to highlight my abilities here in my portfolio.
