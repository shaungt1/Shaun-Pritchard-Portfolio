This is a very interesting topic that I am going to discuss in regards to my credit and everyone else. Credit information has been aggregated and collected from multiple sources without any type of validation auditing for verification of the data that is used to report on a person's credit score. A high percentage of mistakes typically found on most persons credit reports. 



The three main credit bureaus—Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion—have access to the credit history of millions of people. They obtain this information from banks, loan companies, retailers and other lenders. The companies that report information are known as data furnishers. 




data furnishers have been collecting data from people for a very long time. An argument on the legitimacy of the bureaus collecting data is another question and how they stay in business we will discuss in a moment. 





It wasn't until late 1970 when computers where used in credit bureaus to calculate credit score algorithms. Most of the data back then they received was still handwritten on ledgers. It wasn't until after the turn of the century after 2006 when computational systems and Frameworks were Advanced enough start collecting data and building networks between banks phasing out the handwritten data collected.




the point being that recently all data is required virtually through the web or private networks. Even with the data collection process the main credit bureaus still have a lot of inconsistencies in their data. 




As reference below from (Take Control Report, 2016) Experian shows the numbers on the inconsistency and bad quality of the data they acquire. 



Incomplete or missing data 60% 
Outdated information 60% 
Duplicate data 54% 
Inconsistent data 37% 
typos 30 
Spelling mistakes 28% 
Data entered in the incorrect field 26% 
Other inaccuracies account for 1 to 2% 



They claim that from 2016 human error, lack of internal manual resources, inadequate strategies, inadequate data strategy, inadequacies in current technology, a lack of relevant technology, and lack of skills needed to correctly use the existing technology are the main causes of these inadequacies of data. (Take Control Report, 2016). 

 

One of the standpoints I can see from a technological perspective would be the furnishers collecting this data to put in place provisions of Authentication, quality control, and audits to ensure the consistency of data. 



From the credit bureaus, they should implement the same strategies. 


As mentioned earlier I think it's important to note that these credit bureau to acquire all of his personal information collected from a mass array of sources. They then establish these credit FICO scores and report to turn around and re-sell this data to anyone who will pay them for it. 



Essentially the concept of a credit score wasn't fully developed until the 1980s. These credit bureaus are private for-profit companies that determine all of our access in acquiring funds from our trust accounts from the Federal Reserve. 



Many people don't realize that the Federal Reserve is also a for-profit privately owned central bank. Before 1933 real money existed that was backed by Gold and silver. 



No Amendment was ever made, but on June 5, 1933, Congress enacted HJR-192 to suspend the gold standard and to abrogate the gold clause. This resolution declared that "Whereas the holding or dealing in gold affect the public interest, and are therefore subject to proper regulation and restriction; a 



HJR-192 automatically extended the privilege to renege on debts to every person using the Federal Reserve banking system; however, never forget that when you operate on privilege, you have to respect the ruler of the giver of that privilege. Furthermore, in the case of Great Falls Mfg. Co. v. Attorney General, 124 U.S. 581, the court said: "The court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits."



Thus, if you avail yourself of any benefits of the public credit system you waive the right to challenge the validity of any statute pertaining to and conferring the "benefits" of this system on the basis of constitutionality. 



Article 1 Section 10 of the united states Constitution says: 
No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.
 


this is a conflict because by law we are not supposed to use fiat currency, the government has provisioned that all debts public will be discharged by the government since no real money exist. 



So the confinement of a credit score and credit report is denied us from boring money directly from the source who provides it. 



Essentially this is why we have credit scores, birth certificates, and data is collected on each of us and sold without our knowledge and authorization. This is also why we have a deficit all Representatives act on our behalf the people, therefore, they get to spend money on behalf of us when they enact bills that need to be funded the treasury submits this to the Federal Reserve who authorizes it and lets us print more money adding to. 



These are some interesting facts I thought I would share because we work very hard and have to adhere to building our own credit profiles to receive the money we need to live. some of have hardships or make mistakes. none the less we should not make mistakes that disable our ability to the money we should have access to. Banks simply act as an intermediary between us and the Federal Reserve.




The Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, is the federal law that regulates the credit reporting agencies, its data furnishers (translation: your creditors) and entities that are looking or able to sneak a peek at your credit file. It was originally enacted back in 1970 and is designed to promote “the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information” on your credit reports, per the Federal Trade Commission.




The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, or FACT Act, is an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act introduced back in 2003. It’s the law that grants you access to one free credit report every 12 months 



I only mention all this because I'm currently trying to repair my own credit score because there's a lot of inconsistencies on it and there's data that belongs to other people on my credit report. Plus I'm a victim of credit fraud. 



We can write letters to these credit collection companies and by law if they cannot prove within 30 days of the letter being mailed. With valid proof of a signature that a transaction was made what's in that timeline and by law they have to remove any inconsistencies on your credit report. 



A lot of people don't know the information I thought it would be fun to share. My cousin happens to be an attorney I got a 2-year degree in business law from MSSU. I know I got a little bit off-topic from the questions at hand, but I hope you enjoyed this post and maybe have some new ideas to ponder?
