**Project Overview**

Social media use is critical to a dynamic and competitive brand, whether that brand is something you sell, a group home, or a non-profit organization. This project will get you thinking about effective ways to shape your social media tools to make the most of your brand, to keep consumers talking and thinking about your brand, and to get interaction from those you seek to sell to or help. You&#39;ll look at what you post and possible responses as well as use social media trends and society controls to keep your brand meeting your goals.

Your final project should include a plan for a minimum of 4 social media sites, your audience, outreach and advertising thoughts, your posting do&#39;s and don&#39;ts, and explanations of your choices using the sources from the course and others you find. You will have the opportunity to present your project live to classmates and your instructor.
