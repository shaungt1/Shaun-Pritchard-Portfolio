**Welcome to PSY3738 Section 01 The Psychology of Social Media**

**We live in a world that is largely influenced by the media. You can expect to see multiple advertisements daily, to gather your news and other information using sources that have a particular viewpoint they may be pushing, and to have virtual interactions with networks of people and companies you know both in person and only online. Social media plays a big role in many people&#39;s lives as well.**

**Whether you are training to work in the field of psychology or just planning to interact with other people, learning about how we interact with media, and more specifically social media, is an important step.**

**This course examines contemporary psychological influences of social and professional online networks, including advertising. We&#39;ll consider the national and global impact of various sources including online networking, distance team building, and social media&#39;s impact within developmental perspectives. We&#39;ll also explore the psychology of predatory behaviors such as cyber-bullying and trolling.**

**Practically, this class will focus on how people use, learn, and are influenced by social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google+, and more. We&#39;ll work together to understand how different media can be utilized successfully and build a profile in several of these modalities. And the things you learn can be easily applied in your everyday social media use.**
