## **Module 02 - The Scientific Revolution**

## **The Scientific Revolution**

This lecture will focus on how science and physics was practiced before the scientific revolution. In order to understand why this revolution in thinking was so important, it is helpful to look at how physics was studied by some of the first scientists: the ancient Greeks.

There were a number of scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers among the ancient Greeks. Many of these names are familiar: Euclid, Pythagoras, Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle. The contributions from these great thinkers are significant and paved the way for others to contribute to the start of the scientific revolution. In this lecture, we will take a closer look at Aristotle and his study of physics.

Aristotle proposed the idea that all things in nature were composed of the four elements: earth, wind, water, and fire. Objects are composed of varying amounts of these elements. Heavier things such as rock or dirt are made of larger amounts of the element earth. Lighter things such as smoke have more of the element air. The elements are described by their properties: hot, cold, dry, and wet. Another element, sometimes referred to as the fifth element, is the ether and is what heavenly bodies, such as stars and planets, are composed of.

Aristotle proposed that there are two types of motion in the physical world: natural and violent. How objects move depends on which element they are composed of and what the natural position of the object is. Things made of &quot;earth&quot; would strive to return to the Earth and things made of air, such as smoke, would strive to return to the air and move upwards. Natural motion is either straight up and down or circular, reserved for stars and planets.

The other type of motion, called violent motions, only results when an object is pushed or pulled. Aristotle believed that a continuous force is needed to keep an object in motion. While this view in incorrect, the observations Aristotle made generally support this idea. An ox pulling a cart is applying a continuous force to keep the cart moving.

Even though Aristotle&#39;s is not quite correct in his ideas about the physics of motion, he was one of the first scientists to begin to conduct scientific research in a systematic way by making observations, conducting experiments, and organizing his collected knowledge. The physical principle he developed were used for over 2000 years! Aristotle&#39;s work focused on why nature behaves the way it does. When the focus instead turns to &quot;how&quot;, a different view of physical world is revealed.

**Galileo**

![](RackMultipart20201230-4-8tg4pc_html_e8a339e568c36ad6.png)

Galileo, perhaps one of the most famous scientists and philosophers, wanted to understand how objects moved. He was one of the first scientists to show that Aristotle&#39;s ideas were incorrect by relying on observation and experiment. Galileo also made the important contribution by showing how the laws of nature could be described mathematically. Much of his works was an important step toward separating science from both philosophy and religion.

Galileo learned about motion by conducting experiments with rolling objects and inclined planes. He noticed how the balls accelerated as they rolled down the plane and slowed down when they moved up the plane. An interesting question to ask in then what happens when a ball rolls along a flat surface? If the surface is perfect and friction can be ignored, it will neither slows down or speed up. Related to this experiment is the concept of inertia. Galileo recognized that the more inertia an object has, the more difficult it is to change the object&#39;s motion.

Galileo also thought about, and possibly experimented with, the physics of falling objects. In Aristotle&#39;s view, a heavier object will fall more quickly than a lighter object. The famous experiment involving Galileo throwing objects of different weights off the Leaning Tower of Pisa is believed to not actually have happened. But, after years of performing experiments and refining his results, Galileo proposed that all object that are freely falling will fall at the same rate which does not depend on their weight or size. He also recognized that the distance objects fall is proportional to the time squared.

We will now back-track a little bit in time to the beginning of what is called the Copernican Revolution or the big shift from an Earth-centered universe to a Sun-centered one.

For a long time, people believed that the Earth was the center of the Universe. This belief was held by a number of ancient civilizations, including the Greeks. The Egyptian-Greek astronomer Ptolemy wrote what was considered &quot;the&quot; book on astronomy; his geocentric model of the Solar System was the one accepted by nearly everyone. Ptolemy also formalized the use of epicycles which are the smaller circles the planets were thought to travel as they orbited the Earth.

![](RackMultipart20201230-4-8tg4pc_html_4ec0db81808eba10.png)

Because Aristotle viewed the physical world as composed of the classical elements of earth, water, air, fire and aether, it made sense that the world must be Earth centered. The heaviest element was believed to be &quot;earth&quot; - it moves to the center and the other elements surround it according to their densities. The ether is the lightest elements and composes the stars and planets and so must be located outside of the other elements.

The geocentric view dominated science for thousands of years, mainly because to contradict this view was to contradict the Church. At the time, the Church dominated society and to think differently from its prescribed views was very dangerous. The Greek astronomer Aristarchus first proposed the ideas that the Earth revolved around the Sun and that stars were actually other suns. The heliocentric model was not proposed until almost 1800 years later!

The Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus published his work in 1543, very close to the time of death in May of 1543. His ideas were not well received at first by the Church but other astronomers quickly recognized its importance. The Copernican Revolution begins with the publication of this work and ends with Newton&#39;s books on motion and gravitation which derived the physics responsible for the observed planetary motion.

In addition to his work on motion, Galileo also was an accomplished astronomer. He is credited with the invention of the telescope in 1609 and made numerous discoveries which support the heliocentric model. The four largest moons of Jupiter were named in his honor and demonstrated that not everything in the Universe revolves around the Earth. His discovery of sunspots shows that the heaves can change their appearance. Perhaps most importantly, Galileo&#39;s discovery of the phases of Venus agrees with the predictions of the heliocentric model - we could not observe the changing shape of Venus unless both Earth and Venus orbit the Sun.

In this lecture, we have covered quite a bit of important discoveries, from the time of the ancient Greek scientists up until Newton. One of the main points to take away from this lecture is how important the shift from the Earth-centered model to the Sun-centered model is. For thousands of years, Earth was considered the center of everything. Over the course of a century, Copernicus proposed the heliocentric model, Galileo supported the model with observations, and Newton derived the physics governing all motion in the Universe. While there have been many significant scientific discoveries since the Copernican revolution, this shift in our place in the Universe remains one of the most important.

**Changing Perceptions of the World**

In this lecture, the development of Isaac Newton&#39;s theory of gravitation will be explored and how this development in physics changed how we view how physical laws work on the Earth and in the rest of the universe. Before Sir Isaac Newton ![](RackMultipart20201230-4-8tg4pc_html_63c80542e4ca2c5b.png)published his main body of research, it was not well understood how the physical laws on the Earth were connected to the physical laws operating in the rest of the universe. It was assumed that the heavens were governed by separate laws and that these laws did not determine what was observed on Earth.

Galileo&#39;s contributions to our understanding of motion were very significant and refuted much of what Aristotle initially developed and which were taken as fact for 2000 years. Copernicus provided evidence that supported his idea that the Earth was not the center of the Solar System and the astronomer Johannes Kepler derived the laws of planetary motion based on his careful observations of planetary motion. But, an important piece of the puzzle was still missing: &quot;Why do the planets orbit the Sun?&quot; and &quot;Why do objects fall to the Earth?&quot;

The well-known story of an apple falling on Newton&#39;s head and thus providing him with the insight needed to develop his theory of gravity might not be exactly correct.

As Newton told one of his first biographers, the story is that Newton&#39;s was sitting outside in view of an apple tree and as he watched, an apple fall to the ground. He began to think about why objects always fall straight to the Earth and realized that the Earth is pulling on these objects and that there must be some sort of attracting force that causes everything to fall to the center of the Earth.

In his most important publication, Newton drew an illustration of the Earth with a mountain and a cannon on top of the mountain. In this &quot;thought&quot; experiment, a cannon ball is fired at increasingly greater velocities until it falls around the Earth at the same velocity as the Earth&#39;s surface falls away. The cannon ball is in orbit around the Earth! Of course, this would only work if there were no mountains or other obstacles to get in the way, including the atmospheric drag.

![](RackMultipart20201230-4-8tg4pc_html_b3a0027e0d461c14.png)

Newton recognized that the Moon also &quot;falls&quot; around the Earth. The moon has enough velocity to not be pulled into the Earth but is not moving fast enough to escape the Earth&#39;s gravity. The Earth is also &quot;falling&quot; around the Sun. If the Sun suddenly disappeared, the gravitation force would also disappear and the Earth would move in a straight line. ![](RackMultipart20201230-4-8tg4pc_html_eff0755279e31108.png)

The gravitational force F between two objects is proportional to the masses of the objects divided by the square of their separation. This type of relationship is called an inverse square law. As the quantity in the numerator increases (in this case one or both of the masses), the gravitational force will also increase. If the distance between the objects increases, the force will decrease according to the square of the distance.

The importance of Newton&#39;s &quot;discovery&quot; of the law of gravitation is that is shows us that the same laws apply everywhere. Earth is no longer a special place at the center of the Universe. The same physical principle we study on Earth also apply to the Moon and other planets. The same force that causes stars to orbit the center of a galaxy also causes an apple to fall to the ground on a small, blue planet located in that galaxy.

Newton&#39;s Principia is considered to be the greatest physics book ever published. Containing his laws of motion, the theory of gravity, and derivations of planetary motions, it tells us how everything in the universe should move. Physicists call this study Newtonian mechanics.
