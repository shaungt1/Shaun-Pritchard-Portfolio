## **Module 01 - In the Beginning**

- By the end of this module you should be able to:
- Analyze why physics is central to understanding our world.
- Examine when the study of physics first began.
- Examine why physical principles are studied.
- Explore physics in relation to the physical behavior of the natural world.
- Evaluate how physics impacts other fields in science, humanities, and medicine.

### **Patterns in Physics**

We are surrounded by patterns. There are patterns and shapes in the night sky, made by stars and planets. There are patterns in the weather, where even the shapes of the clouds indicate if it will be sunny or rainy in the future. People eventually learned to make predictions from the patterns that they observed. For example, the Sun sets at different points along the horizon throughout the year. When it is at a particular location, it may mean it is time to plant seeds to harvest crops. The more patterns that we observe and record, the easier it is to make predictions and to verify those predictions. Science research is accomplished by asking questions, making predictions, doing experiments, and forming ![](RackMultipart20201230-4-nj2wft_html_4b0b21005618ca86.png)conclusions. Even as the questions we try to answer change, the way we do science will remain constant.

People have always asked questions. The questions they first asked seem to be very simple to us now but at the time, were not easy to answer. How big is the Earth? What is light and matter? Is the Earth at the center of the Universe? As the practice of science progressed, and the first questions were answered, our questions became more complex. What is the speed of light? When and how did the Universe begin? What is gravity? What is dark energy? Even when these questions are answered there will always be more to ask!

Physics is the study of nature at its most fundamental level. Physics answers questions about the interaction between energy, matter, space and time. When physicists describe the laws that govern the Universe, they often use complicated equations and need to understand a lot of math. But for anyone to understand physics in a conceptual way, there is no need to memorize complicated formulas or to write down pages of math. Physics describes things on the very smallest scales. The standard model of physics describes subatomic particles such as quarks which combine to make protons and neutrons which in turn make up atoms which are the building blocks of all the matter in the Universe! Physics also describes the laws of the Universe on the ![](RackMultipart20201230-4-nj2wft_html_106505ce64cd43c.png)largest scales. How did stars and galaxies form and how did they interact? How does the light from these stars and galaxies change as it travels across the Universe? When and how did the Universe form?

And physics also describes everything in between, such as the motion of the Sun, Moon, and stars. Many things about the Earth: Why do we have tides? What are earthquakes caused by? How does the length of our day change? How does gravity affect objects on the Earth? How do radio waves travel across the world?

Many technologies in modern medicine are based on physics. Pretty much everything can be explained by physics at some level.

![](RackMultipart20201230-4-nj2wft_html_ba0c1310713cd097.png)All scientific disciples make use of a specific method for answering questions. A simplified version of the process is to first formulate a question, often based on an observation. The next step is to collect data or perform experiments. After analyzing the data, conclusions can be made to answer the initial question.

An interesting situation is shown in this image. These &quot;sailing rocks&quot; found in certain arid locations were puzzling to scientists. The rocks are usually quite heavy and are not easy to move. The location is often visited when conditions are dry so it was difficult to see how other conditions could affect the surface and the rocks.

So scientists asked the question: How did this rock create this track? Through experiment, they could recreate the conditions that may have allowed the rock to slide along the surface. They found that when the ground was wet, the clay ![](RackMultipart20201230-4-nj2wft_html_e215809f9fb531d2.png)minerals in the soil became slippery, allowing an object, such as a heavy rock, to slide it was pushed easily. Rain storms would make the surface wet and usually also produce wind. The conclusion to be draw would be that the storms plus wind occurring at certain times of year would allow the rocks to easily slide across the surface and create the track.

So, we now know a little bit about what science is and what type of question we can answer by studying physics. You may still wonder - why do we care? Why go to all the trouble to learn about physics? Well, because physics is a fundamental science, it is connected to, well, everything. We have already looked at how physics helps us understand our place in the Universe. Many discoveries in the past have led to even more significant discoveries which in turn pave the way for future research.

Physics is the basis of many other fields of science. Exploring the natural world helps us to understand the nature of reality. When we measure something, what are we really measuring? What is matter really made of? And of course, physics affects our daily life through the inventions of many important modern technologies, including medical technologies. Without the devices and technologies that we use every day, life would certainly be very different.

As one of the oldest fields of science, people have been studying the physical world since before recorded history. Even as more complex questions are asked and answered, the process of doing science remains essentially the same. The technologies developed through physics have greatly changed our world and help us to better understand our place in that world.

**Technology Developed from Physics Research**

In this lecture we will introduce the impact physics has had on society by looking at the development of some of the technologies that we use in everyday life. This lecture will focus on how technological advances have changed society rather than about the physical principles that went into their development.

We use physics every day. Even something as simple as a light bulb requires an understanding of electricity and how various material behave as they are heat. All technological advances build on previous discoveries and research. Let&#39;s take a look at some of the major technological advances made in the last century.

![](RackMultipart20201230-4-nj2wft_html_4f70539685aeece0.png)

Long before anyone could simply pick up a phone, the only way to communicate was either by letter or by sending a telegram. The telegraph itself represented a significant advancement as it allowed people to quickly send and receive information over great distances, especially across the Atlantic Ocean. In the last 150 years or so, communication technology advanced rapidly and now instant global communication is possible, which has immensely benefitted society.

In the early 1900s, at the time that the radio was being developed, the only way to quickly contact anyone located a long distance away was by using a telegraph to send and receive Morse code. The telephone, which was invented in the late 1800&#39;s, was used by hundreds of thousands of people by the early 1900&#39;s but telephone lines did not yet extend across the United States and certainly not across an ocean. In addition, a telephone was moderately expensive, not very private, and required the use of switchboards and operators.

Now, think about how easy to place a phone call, either using a telephone or a cellular phone. While there are issues with privacy in the digital age, phone calls today are relatively private - you don&#39;t have to worry about the switchboard operator (or your neighbors) listening in on your conversations!

Modern radio and phone technology, along with advances in computer technology, has a significant impact on how we communicate, as individuals and with governments, other scientists, and other countries. World events are almost instantly communicated across the globe. For example, there is no longer a need to wait weeks for election results. Countries experiencing a natural disaster are able to quickly receive help. From a cultural perspective, it is important to learn about how others live in different parts of the world. It is also possible to use modern technologies to &quot;travel&quot; to other parts of the world while remaining in your own home through the use of documentary videos and broadcast television.

The ability to easily communicate with people is other countries has had a significant impact on scientific collaboration. Scientists are able to work with researchers in other countries and to use equipment such as telescopes remotely. It is possible to provide access to resources scientists may be lacking and to share results of experiments. This type of international collaboration has many benefits to the scientific community and society in general.

Advances in phone and radio technology is tied in with advances in computers. Without the devices which allow for fast data processing, small portable devices, and large amounts of data storage, communication would still be limited.

![](RackMultipart20201230-4-nj2wft_html_6b2e8f0bead65a4f.png)

Long before even the first simple devices that could do rudimentary computations, people used very simple inventions, such as a sundial, to tell the time.

As the need for predictions about other natural phenomena arose, such as the calculation of when tides would occur, the devices created became more complex. The advent of the &quot;digital age&quot; was still many years away, but the simple clocks and other machines that people invented were useful nonetheless. The slide rule for example, was used for making mathematical calculations and it wasn&#39;t until the introduction of the scientific calculator in the late 1970s that the era of the slide rule ended.

One of the first computers, the ENIAC, was developed in the 1940s and is not what most people today would recognize as a computer. Easily filling an entire room, it was extremely heavy and very slow compared to even the simplest computers today. But it represented a huge advance in technology as people were able to quickly calculate mathematical functions. The ENIAC was also not for the general public and was used instead by the military for ballistics calculations.

After numerous developments in electronics, including solid state technology, today&#39;s modern computers continue to become smaller, faster and cheaper. And importantly, readily available and affordable for the general public. As of 2012, almost 80% of all households in the United States have a computer. Computers, including iPad, tablets, are used for educational purposes, household tasks (for example, calculating taxes), and of course, entertainment. There are few things our computers are not used for!

While home computers significantly affect our daily lives, even large super computers play an important role. A supercomputer is a collection of computer processors, usually located in close proximity to each other, that work together resulting in extremely fast computing speed. These machines are used in applications that require extensive calculations, such as simulations of atoms and molecules or even modeling the very beginning of the Universe. All of these technologies make important contributions to society.

Physics has also played an important role in the development of medical imaging technologies. Before the existence of X-rays, MRI scanners, and ultrasound imaging, people relied on a very hands-on method to learn about the human body. Almost all of the information learned about the body prior to the late 1800s was discovered by actually viewing the inside of the human body. Some of the earliest anatomical drawings were made by Leonardo da Vinci in the early 1500s. His illustrations were quite detailed and provided the physicians at the time with valuable information about how the various systems of the body worked together.

It wasn&#39;t until the late 1800s that an understanding of physics developed enough to use radiation to see inside of the body. The first X-ray image was taken in 1896 of the wife of Wilhelm Roentgen, the scientist who ![](RackMultipart20201230-4-nj2wft_html_f6fb09503edd7f55.png) discovered X-ray radiation and for which he received the first Nobel Prize in physics in 1901. Only a few months after the discovery of X-rays and their use for seeing inside of the human body, X-rays were being used to take images of broken bones. Modern X-rays images are much higher quality and the radiation dose can be controlled more carefully than in the past.

Improvements in medical imaging allows doctors to more quickly make a diagnosis and treat medical issues. Access to these technologies has also reduced health care costs because health issues can be addressed sooner, resulting in fewer treatments and an overall reduced cost of medical care.

Another technology with a significant impact on society involves the use of nuclear processes to both generate energy and to make weapons. The first nuclear reactor was built in 1942, electricity was first generated in 1951, and the first nuclear-powered submarine was launched in 1955. As of 2011, about 10% of the world&#39;s electricity is generated using nuclear power.

The use of nuclear power is a complex issue and many people have concerns about safety both regarding the operation of reactors and the disposal of nuclear waste. Following the Tohoku earthquake in Japan in 2011, the number of nuclear reactors has declined as safety and operating procedures are reassessed.

The issue of developing and using nuclear weapons is also of great concern to society. After the test of the first nuclear bomb in 1945, many weapons have been developed and built, with only two bombs being used at the end of World War II. There are numerous treaties that various countries have signed in agreement to restrict and reduce the development and testing of nuclear weapons. The existence of nuclear weapons will continue to be an important international issue.
