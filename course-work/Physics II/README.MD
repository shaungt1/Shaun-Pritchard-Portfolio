![](RackMultipart20201230-4-sba1i9_html_237499165a11f2b9.gif)

This is a repo for all the physics work , thesis, abstracts, and course work I did for 4000 level physics class. This is for my personal reference and usage. Please feel free to view and critique my work or contact me if you&#39;re interested in working on an abstract that I have published based on the course work.

## Course Project

**Project Overview**

The Course Project gives you the opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the course competencies and module objectives through the production of authentic project deliverables. Each course project assignment is designed to represent a real-life decision, document, or artifact that you will be expected to produce when working as a professional in the field.

You are required to use the knowledge gained in the content of each module to complete the individual course project assignments.

**Due Date**

There are individual assignments along the way. The module they are due is noted in the timeline below.

**Timeline**

| **Module** | **Assignment** |
| --- | --- |
| **01** | **Physics Principles Research Paper** |
| **02** | **Scientific Method Research Paper** |
| **03** | **Electricity, Magnetism, and Light Compare/Contrast Paper** |
| **04** | **Einstein&#39;s Physics Compare/Contrast Paper** |
| **05** | **Quantum Mechanics Research Paper** |

**Requirements**

Each course project deliverable must have correct spelling and grammar. Each paper must be in APA format. Wikipedia is not a credible website and may not be used.
