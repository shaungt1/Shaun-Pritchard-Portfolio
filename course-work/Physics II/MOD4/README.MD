**Waves, Particles, and Measurement**

In this lecture we will explore our understanding of light as having properties of both a wave and a particle. We will learn about some of the important experiments which helped us to formulate the wave and particle theories of light. By the end of the lecture, you should be able to identify the ways in which light acts like a wave and how it acts like a particle.

Light surrounds us all day, every day, from sunrise to sunset and back again to sunrise. Natural light dominates the daytime sky and artificial light outshines the light from distant stars and galaxies, some of which has been traveling through the universe for billions of years. We use light to illuminate our books, light up our computer screens, show airplanes where to land, and to make our homes bright and comfortable. As far back as 400 BC, people were formulating ideas about the nature of light.

The ancient Greek philosopher Plato though that light consisted of a stream of particles that were emitted from the eye. Around 100 years later, the mathematician Euclid still held this same view, but did recognize some of the important properties of light such as the fact that light travels in a straight line and the laws of reflection.

Almost 2000 years later, experimental evidence was still scarce. Sir Isaac Newton, in addition to his work on motion and gravity, also thought about the nature of light. He believed that light was composed of a stream of particles or corpuscles. Even though he was aware of some of the experiments that indicated light also has wave properties, he continued to advance his corpuscular theory of light. His contemporary, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens, had published his wave theory of light about 15 years prior to Newton&#39;s optics work, but Huygen&#39;s theory could not explain certain observations and so was not accepted.

![](RackMultipart20201230-4-4zeodw_html_89134bfbb6e5d7d0.png)

Following the publication of Newton&#39;s Opticks, the next one hundred years was dominated by his particle theory of light. The English physicist Thomas Young disagreed with this view and proposed a wave theory of light which he supported through experimentation. He used demonstrations with water waves to produce interference patterns, where the peaks and troughs of the water waves add together or subtract in a particular way. Young also demonstrated this same behavior with light with his famous double-slit experiment, which we will discuss later in this lecture.

Before we take a look at Young&#39;s experiment, let&#39;s first introduce the concept of interference. All wave exhibit this phenomena - sound waves, water waves, and of course, light waves. When the peaks and troughs of waves line up, then add together which is called constructive interference. When a peak lines up with a trough, they subtract or cancel, which is called destructive interference. ![](RackMultipart20201230-4-4zeodw_html_9feb738c5e88cfc1.png)

It is also important to look at another property of waves called diffraction. When waves pass through an opening about the same size as their wavelength, the waves spread out behind the opening. This can be observed for water waves moving through an opening in a seawall. In the experiment we will talk about next, light was also observed to diffract through an opening, which can only occur if light behaves as a wave.

In 1804, Thomas Young described his experiment demonstrating the that light exhibit interference, or when the peaks and troughs of light waves constructively and destructively interfere as discussed in the previously. Young used sunlight streaming through a screen with a small opening. He placed a thin card in the beam of light and observed an interference pattern, where the different colors of the light waves added and subtracted. When light was blocked on one side of the card, the pattern disappeared, indicating that the light waves passing on each side of the card were interfering, which could only occur if light is a wave.

A modern experimental set-up is to use a screen with two very narrow slits. As light passes through each slit, it diffracts through the opening and spreads out, interfering with the light passing through the other slit. When viewed on a screen, a clear interference pattern of light and dark lines can be observed. This experiment is often done using a laser for the source because laser light contains only one wavelength of light and the light is coherent or has all of the peaks and troughs ![](RackMultipart20201230-4-4zeodw_html_598e8f8c2be5dcff.png)aligned.

While we can&#39;t directly observe that light is a wave like we can see water or sound waves, there are many technologies that take advantage of the ability of light waves to interfere. Holograms are one such technology that makes use of interference to produce three dimensional images. There are many different types of holograms and a number of different ways in which to create a holographic image. The basic process of producing a hologram involves recording an interference pattern produced by light reflected from an object and light from a reference beam. The information recorded on film allows a viewer to see an object in 3D and to also see the perspective of the image change as the viewpoint changes. Some of the types of holograms shown here are used for security purposes. Because it is difficult to recreate the exact holographic image, holograms are often used on currency, especially notes that have large values.

Before we move on to discuss the evidence for light existing as a particle, it is necessary to define what is meant by a wave and a particle. A wave can be thought of as a pattern. We can see a wave when it moves something, such as water. A wave can be defined by its velocity and wavelength. A particle on the other had is made of a specific quantify of something, such as mass or energy. In the rest of this lecture, we will learn about how scientists discovered that light also behaves as a particle.

During various experiments, scientists began to notice that shining light on a particular type of metal surface resulted in electrons being removed or ejected from the surface. This process can be partly described using light waves: the energy from the light wave would cause the electrons to vibrate until they had enough energy to break free from the metal surface. But, there were some problems associated with using a wave model of light.

First, as soon as light shines on the surface, the electrons are ejected. There was no time needed to build up enough energy to free the electrons. Scientists also noticed that when the amount of light was increased, more electrons were ejected from the surface. But, these electrons did not have a greater amount of energy, there were just more of them. This was confusing! Experiments also showed that low-frequency light, such as infrared light, did not cause any electrons to be ejected. But high-frequency light, such as ultraviolet light, does eject electrons. A specific amount of energy seemed to be necessary to remove the electrons.

Einstein put the pieces of the puzzle together. If light of a certain energy is required to eject electrons from a metal surface, then light must exist in &quot;energy packets&quot; - only light with the enough energy can remove an electron from the metal surface. These energy packets are called photons. Photons with more energy could eject electrons that had more energy or were moving faster. This phenomena is called the photoelectric effect and Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for this work.

There are many applications that take advantage of the photoelectric effect. One of the most important devices that has been developed is called a photomultiplier tube. This technology converts light into an electrical signal that can be measured. Photomultiplier tubes are extremely sensitive and can detect the light from even a single photon! When a photon entering the tube strikes a metal plate, it releases an electron. This electron moves through the tube, releasing more and more electrons which is measured as an electric current.

![](RackMultipart20201230-4-4zeodw_html_eb9b52bba7c17753.png)

Photomultiplier tubes are used extensively in special particle detector built to detect certain types of particles that can tell us about the origins of the Universe. In this image, thousands of photomultiplier tubes are seen inside of the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment. These PMTs measure the very small amount of light emitted by the liquid inside the detector when a particle moves through the liquid.

PMTs are also used extensively in many other applications which have a more direct influence on daily life. For example, they are used to monitor the radiation exposure of workers in the nuclear power industry and in hospital radiography environments. Photomultipliers are used in medical imaging as the detector part of a gamma camera which takes images of special radioactive isotopes introduced into the body to help with a diagnosis. PMTs can also be used to measure the amount of polluting gases emitted by cars and other vehicles.

We now know that light can be explained as both a wave and a particle. In a way, both Newton and Huygens were correct in their theories. It may seem somewhat confusing to think about light having these two different properties but here is a way to look at: light (or photons) travel as a wave and when the photons interact with something, such as a metal surface, they behave as a particle.

**The Discovery of Electromagnetism**

In this lecture, we will learn about the discovery of electromagnetism. Considered one of the most important developments in physics since Newton&#39;s work on the laws of motion and gravitation, James Clerk Maxwell&#39;s mathematical description of electromagnetism resulted in the discovery that light is an electromagnetic wave. This new understanding of electromagnetism directly led to many new technologies including communication using radio wave, electric motors, and how we generate power and send electricity to our homes and businesses.

By the beginning of the 19th century, it was demonstrated by Thomas Young that light has properties of a wave. We can see that light will interfere with itself and that the waves have a particular orientation in space, which results in polarization. But there was still something missing - if light is a wave, what is the medium through which it travels?

Sound wave move through the air and waves in the ocean obviously travel across the water. But, what exactly is &quot;waving&quot; when it comes to light? Since the time of the ancient Greeks, people thought that space is filled with something called the luminiferous ether that everything moves through, including the Earth.

![](RackMultipart20201230-4-4zeodw_html_75404e6e10c560de.png)

In order to determine if something like the ether could affect the speed of light as it traveled through space, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley conducted an experiment in 1887 in order to measure how light might be affected as it travels in two different directions. One direction would be in the same direction as the ether &quot;wind&quot; and the other direction would be perpendicular. Each path is exactly the same but if something, like the ether, causes the light to slow down, then light will take longer to travel the path. When the light form each path is later combined, a change in the interference pattern would show that the light was slowed down on one of the paths.

The Michelson-Morley experiment has sometimes been called the most famous &quot;failed&quot; experiment because they did not find any evidence that an ether wind was present. Despite the results of this experiment, James Clerk Maxwell still incorporated some properties of the ether in his work. Only with the work of Albert Einstein on his theory of special relativity in the early 1900s, the notion of the ether was finally dismissed. Before we explore Maxwell&#39;s discovery of electromagnetism, let&#39;s take a quick look at electric and magnetic fields.

There is something called an electric field which is present around any charged particle. For example, electrons have a negative charge and create an electric field. Opposite charges attract each other and like charges repel. The charges in this image are stationary - they are not moving.

![](RackMultipart20201230-4-4zeodw_html_33d580f1671e071d.png)

A magnetic field can be produced by an object which contains certain elements, such as iron or nickel, which result in a magnetic field that is always present. The magnets on your refrigerator are made of these types of materials. But, magnetic fields are also associated with electric changes and electric fields. A moving charge or changing electric field also creates a magnetic field. For many years, scientists believed that electric fields and magnetic field were two separate things.

But, as scientists continued to conduct experiments with electric current and magnetic fields, they made some very important discoveries. First, Hans Christian Oersted demonstrated that a changing current moving through a wire changed the direction of a compass needle. This means that a changing current must produce a magnetic field! Another physicist, Michael Faraday, also discovered that a changing magnetic field produces a current. This is called electromagnetic induction and is the basis for how electric motors operate. So, now scientists know there is a connection between electricity and magnetism but what exactly does this mean?

The Scottish mathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell took all of the concepts known about electric fields, magnetic fields, and their interaction and determined the mathematical equations which describe them. This combined phenomena is called electromagnetism and it basically describes how electromagnetic fields are created and how they interact with matter and other fields. Since all matter is composed of atoms, electromagnetic theory describes, well, almost everything! But, there is still one very important concept to discuss.

Maxwell also determined the speed at which electromagnetic waves travel: it was equal to the speed of light! This means that light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell&#39;s equations also show that electromagnetic waves can travel in a vacuum - they do not need a medium through which to move.

![](RackMultipart20201230-4-4zeodw_html_59f12210bb21835b.png)

Almost 25 years later, Maxwell&#39;s predictions were finally tested when Heinrich Hertz generated and transmitted radio waves in his laboratory. The unit of frequency is called the hertz and represents cycles per second. The lower the frequency, the smaller the number.

The radiation emitted over all frequencies and described by Maxwell&#39;s equations is called the electromagnetic spectrum. We now understand that radio waves, microwaves, visible light, and X-rays are all the same phenomena but have different wavelengths. Only some of the radiation is visible to the human eye, called, of course, visible light. Other radiation can be damaging to our cells, such as the high energy X-rays. Longer wavelength and thus lower energy radio waves can travel long distances in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and are very useful for communication.

James Clerk Maxwell&#39;s contributions to scientific thought are nicely summarized by the physicists Richard Feynman and Albert Einstein. Before Maxwell discovered that light is only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum, physics was, in a way, disconnected. Light was seen as something separate from electricity and magnetism, which in turn were not connected to each other. Without Maxwell&#39;s contributions, our comprehension of the nature would still be very limited and we would not be able to use the many technologies that keep us connected.

**The Physics of Measurement**

In this lecture we will discuss the behavior of matter at the atomic scale; this field of physics is called quantum physics or quantum mechanics. We are familiar how matter behaves on larger scales: if you kick a ball, you can determine fairly accurately (with a few calculations) where the ball will end up. But for very small particles, the physics needed to describe their behavior is different.

The questions that will be considered as we go through this material mostly relate to the behavior of matter on the atomic scale and how it might demonstrate properties of both a wave and a particle. The next part of the lecture will focus on how the process of making measurements or observations could affect the outcome of an experiment. In this lecture, we will also talk about the somewhat famous Schrödinger&#39;s Cat thought experiment.

We will consider three thought experiment. A thought experiment is w way to think about something that might not be physically possible to set-up. These types of exercises can still provide useful information about the behavior of particles and waves. Keep in mind that the measurements made in each of these experiments are physically possible to make but they may require complicated equipment.

You may recall from the lecture on the wave and particle nature of light, that the double-slit experiment for light was first performed by Thomas Young in 1084 to demonstrate that light had the properties of a wave. A modern form of this experiment shows that when light passes through two narrow slits, the light waves interfere and create a pattern of light and dark bands when the light falls on a screen. We will use this same experimental set-up for the next three experiments.

![](RackMultipart20201230-4-4zeodw_html_6fca0edf6e2464a3.png)

Let&#39;s start our first experiment by looking at what happens to water waves as they pass through an opening. Let&#39;s assume the waves are lined up nicely as they approach the opening from the left of the image. First, block one opening so the waves pass through one opening at a time. If we could measure the height of the waves on some sort of screen or detector, the waves would make a pattern where there is one part with high amplitude and then it spreads out to lower amplitudes. Now, let the waves pass through both openings at the same time. The pattern is different! There are a series of &quot;highs&quot; and &quot;lows&quot; where the waves are adding together and subtracting. This pattern does not look like you could simply add the patterns for the left and right slits together. Instead, it is a new pattern created by interference of the waves from each slit.

Okay, so now let&#39;s do the experiment with something that is definitely not a wave. Using a paint ball gun, we will send paint balls at the screen with the two openings and look at the pattern on a backstop where the paint lands. Following the same method as for the water wave experiment, first block one of the slits and note the pattern made by the paint and then block the other slit and also record the pattern. Finally, leave both slits open and once again take a look at the pattern created. In this experiment, the patterns created with each slit blocked do add up to the pattern with both slits blocked - the individual paint balls do not interfere with either themselves or the other paint balls as they pass through the slits.

Now we will do the experiment with something a little more difficult to visualize: electrons. Remember that electrons are the negatively charged particles that surround the nucleus of an atom. But that is not important here other than to note they are just very small pieces of matter. Using a device which emits electrons one at a time, let&#39;s send them at the screen with two slits, first closing one slit at a time, and recording where the electrons hit the backstop. When we do this experiment, we notice that the pattern formed is not like the paint ball experiment, which we would expect as electrons are particles. Initially, we expected the electrons to also act like paint balls. But instead, the pattern on the backstop looks almost exactly like the water wave pattern. This tells us that the electrons are behaving as waves and not particles!

So, how can we change to experiment to test exactly what the electrons are doing? Because we have set our electron device to only send out one electron at a time, how can the electron interfere with itself? Maybe it is splitting in half, with each part going through a different slit? Is there a way to look at the electrons to see which slit they travel through? If we set up a very bright light source near the slits, when the electron passes through one of the slits, it will create a bright flash as it interacts with the light - the flash will be near the slit the electron passed through. When we look at all the places the electrons hit the backstop, we notice that the pattern has changed - it now looks like the paint ball experiment. The electrons go through either one slit or the other and the interference pattern has disappeared.

So now we know that when we observe the experiment, we somehow change the results. By &quot;watching&quot; the electrons, they behave like particles and not waves. But what if we change how we watch the electrons. Is there a way to observe them without disturbing the experiment? If we change the light source so that the energy is lower, that might eliminate the effect on the electrons. When we decrease the wavelength of the light, the energy is lower. But, because the wavelength is longer and larger than the distance between the slits, we can&#39;t determine which slit the electron went through! But, now that we can&#39;t determine the path of the electron, the interference pattern has returned. The electrons are one again acting like waves. The idea that quantum particles, like electrons and photons, can behave as both a wave and particle is a central concept to the study of quantum mechanics. This idea fundamentally changed how people thought about reality!

These three experiments demonstrate how trying to observe an experiment or making a measurement affects the outcome of the experiment. A famous physics thought experiment invented by the physicist Erwin Schrödinger provides a way to visualize what it means to make an observation of a quantum system. Schrödinger was an Austrian physicist who studied, among other things, how matter behaves on very small scales, called quantum mechanics. He is famous for developing the wave equation, which describes how particles move as waves.

In the experiment, a cat is placed in a box with a container of poison and a radioactive atom and the box is then sealed. When the atom decays, it causes the poison to be released, killing the cat. But if the atom does not decay, no poison is released and the cat remains alive. Remember - this is only a thought experiment and cats were not actually placed in boxes with poison to test quantum mechanical theories. It is also important to note that we need to assume everything in the experiment works perfectly, the cat cannot interfere with the poison, and there is no way for an observer to otherwise determine what is happening inside of the box. Now, it is not known exactly when the atom will decay. There is only a probability that it will decay within a certain amount of time. While you are conducting the experiment, the atom may or may not decay. So what can we say about the state of the cat - is it alive or dead?

If we open the box, we would be able to observe the state of the cat. If we see the cat happily sitting there, then we know the atom did not decay and release the poison.

Or if we open the box and observe the unfortunate kitty obviously not alive, then we know that the atom must have decayed and released the poison. But, what about before we make our observation? Remember that we do not know what happened to the atom and we can only find out when we make an observation of our experiment. The cat is in the box and is either alive or dead but not until we look. The paradox is that the cat must be both alive and dead at the same time before our measurement! This thought experiment or paradox can help us to understand how quantum particles can have two states at the same time. Notice I said quantum particles. This is an important distinction to make because a cat is not a particle - it is made of an awful lot of atoms. A cat or any other object composed of many atoms does not exhibit quantum behaviour.

When you first begin to think about the very smallest scales in physics, it may seem that there are not any useful applications. Sure, scientists likes to study all sort of different particles and where they come from and what happens to them along the way, but are there any ways in which quantum physics affects your daily life? As with many areas of physics, there are many practical applications for quantum mechanics! A few examples are shown on this slide. Quantum mechanics is used to make atomic clocks even more accurate, which has applications for calculating spacecraft trajectories. Quantum physics is also used in cryptography or the process of securing information. If a key is made by manipulating the quantum states of atoms, any measurements of that key will disturb the state of the atoms and the receiver will know the key was intercepted. In computer technology, quantum physics may be used in the future by using quantum bits or qubits instead of the binary digits or bits currently used in computers. Quantum computers would contain a lot more information and have much faster processing speeds.
