**Module 06 - Introduction to Enterprise Architecture and Cloud Services**

This is an overview of the course work I completed for the given topic. Each module contains specific tasks for both a course project and an assignment.

Course is broken down into modules; each folder will be labeled as MOD with the corresponding module number for the term of that specific section of the course work.

This lab helps you learn how to create reports from data stored within a database system. It does not matter where the database is stored whether the database is local or in a cloud system somewhere, the concepts in this lab are still the same when compared to other types of databases. As you gain more experience working with table records then using and managing the database itself, eventually working with queries will become easier. Using the existing database that were built in a previous lab, you will write basic SQL queries to retrieve the data.

**Create a new Word lab document for this week&#39;s lab objectives then take screenshots of all your work and paste into the document for submission.**

**Lab Objectives Checklist**

- Write an SQL Select Statement
- Apply a Wildcard to the Select Statement
- Apply a Filter to a Select Statement
- Apply Wildcards to a Filter
- Login to the phpMyAdmin Client
- Utilize the MySQL Database Management Tool
- Retrieve Data from a Specific Database Table

**Project Objectives Checklist**

1. Enhance the project documentation
2. Create a final project signature page
3. Write a typical change request scenario
4. Write a professional change request procedure
5. Submit the module use-case document to the course Dropbox for grading

During these project objectives, you will work with project scope and handling changes to prevent catastrophic failure to the project. The project scope is usually defines as the use-case documentation is created and approved. The project manager should finally get signatures from the other managers when everyone agrees on the final draft of the project. The final draft is the scope and it will typically not change unless there is a change request.

1. **At the bottom of the project use-case documentation, add a signature page for all required manager signatures.** Make sure the signature page looks and feels professional which should include the date of when a manager signed the use-case documentation for approval. You have more objectives in the course to build and integrate into your documentation but this should always be the last page of the document.
2. **Next document a typical scenario that might actually be a good reason to change the scope of a project.** For instance, the documentation might not include form validation controls. As the users are testing, the validation is always necessary to keep the data clean in the database. Create your own scenario that could change the scope of the project and would cause the managers to agree and accept the change request.
3. **Document the change request procedure.** This professional procedure would be used in a business when a tester found an issue that requires a project change and the requestor would need to follow through each step before the change would even be considered. Document the procedure in a chronological order as if each step was a checklist.
