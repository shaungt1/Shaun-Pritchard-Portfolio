I am pleased to welcome you to my AI graduate work section. The following repository contains resources that outline my research and work for my professional advanced degree in Artificial Intelligence at Florida Atlantic University, College of Engineering and Computer Science.

In addition to the research documentation and jupyter notebooks related to each project, I have also provided code sources for the advanced work I have done.

For a list of current research projects in progress or published, please see the contents below.
As my chosen field of study, artificial intelligence, this repository displays my abilities in computational science.

> All acedmiic work is 6000 to 8000 level
