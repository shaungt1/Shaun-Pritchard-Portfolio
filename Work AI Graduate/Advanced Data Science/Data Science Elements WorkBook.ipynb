However, they have two major limitations.\n","\n","The first limitation is that the second variable in a stacked plot must be a variable with a very limited number of possible values (probably an ordinal categorical, as here). Five different types of wine is a good number because it keeps the result interpretable; eight is sometimes mentioned as a suggested upper bound. Many dataset fields will not fit this critereon naturally, so you have to \"make do\", as here, by selecting a group of interest.\n","\n","The second limitation is one of interpretability. As easy as they are to make, and as pretty as they look, stacked plots make it really hard to distinguish concrete values. For example, looking at the plots above, can you tell which wine got a score of 87 more often: Red Blends (in purple), Pinot Noir (in red), or Chardonnay (in green)? It's actually really hard to tell!"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"hidden":true,"id":"mozbrdrpV2il"},"source":["# Plots entire dataframe\n","df.plot.area()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"hidden":true,"id":"Bl4iFWp5V2il"},"source":["### Bivariate Line Chart\n",">Bivariate Line Chat is highly effective Because the line in this chart takes up so little visual space, it's really easy and effective to overplot multiple lines on the same chart."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"hidden":true,"id":"HXBEYfVsV2im"},"source":["#Plots entire dataframe\n","df.plot.line()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"hidden":true,"id":"iM4scq8ZV2im"},"source":["## SeaBorn Plots"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"hidden":true,"id":"RvhlUU5uV2im"},"source":["# Import Seaborn agian for good measmeasure \n","import seaborn as sns\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"hidden":true,"id":"VY8BeobnV2im"},"source":["# Set parameters and themes\n","sns.set_theme(style=\"darkgrid\")\n","plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [6, 2]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"hidden":true,"id":"6xGQ8X5VV2im"},"source":["## Load DataFrame into SeaBorn\n","\n","> You must load datafram and colum vectors into seaborn valrible to proccess"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"hidden":true,"id":"gqITjZNrV2im"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"hidden":true,"id":"RonOcMwHV2im"},"source":["## Join Plots\n","> URL: http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.jointplot.html?highlight=join%20plot\n","\n","- requires x, y vectors or keys in data values\n","- More Seaborn plots and tutorials: http://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"hidden":true,"id":"6tEDKtRkV2im"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"hidden":true,"id":"axhA0v7SV2im"},"source":["#Purple JoinPlot (color='m')\n","# USE SEABORN TO PLOT JOINGRID PLOT\n","# Custom the inside plot: options are: “scatter” | “reg” | “resid” | “kde” | “hex”\n","fig.set_size_inches(11.7, 8.27)\n","sns.jointplot(x=obj_df[\"YOUR_COLUMN_X\"], y=obj_df[\"YOUR_COLUMN_Y\"], kind='reg', truncate=True, xlim=(0, 60), ylim=(0, 5), color=\"m\", height=10,)\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"hidden":true,"id":"Qv_Oe5_lV2in"},"source":["# Blue JoinPlot (edgecolor=\"skyblue\")\n","# USE SEABORN TO PLOT JOINGRID PLOT\n","# Custom the inside plot: options are: “scatter” | “reg” | “resid” | “kde” | “hex”\n","fig.set_size_inches(11.7, 8.27)\n","sns.jointplot(x=obj_df[\"YOUR_COLUMN_X\"], y=obj_df[\"YOUR_COLUMN_Y\"], kind='scatter', height=15,linewidth=2, edgecolor=\"skyblue\")\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true,"id":"a9jTIq6iV2in"},"source":["# Advanced Statistics and Visulization"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"hidden":true,"id":"-nmRJ2_eV2in"},"source":["## Multiple regresion Histogram"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"hidden":true,"id":"WBdIqxdGV2in"},"source":["# multiple histograms\n","\n","df = df.set_index(['YOUR_COLUMN'])\n","df.iloc[0]=0\n","df=df.cumsum()\n","    \n","#Create Displot loop through column data features\n","for column in df.columns:\n","    plt.figure()             \n","    sns.distplot(df[column])"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
