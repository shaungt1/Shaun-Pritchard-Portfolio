# **Project Overview**

**Please use this Scenario and Information for all course project components.**

You are an _Eastern Hemisphere Communications Director_ for the Infectious Disease Task Force (IDTF). A new and extremely deadly Ebola-like hemorrhagic virus has been discovered along the Chari River in The Republic of Chad, Africa, infecting volunteers for _Médecins Sans Frontières_ before anyone knew how serious the infection was. By the time the WHO (World Health Organization) could react, the disease had already spread to Algeria, Zanzibar, and South Africa. It is the pandemic the WHO Director-General has feared for months.

The WHO needs to communicate prevention and treatment techniques efficiently and swiftly with local clinics across the entire African continent. A more universal form of communication—a lingua franca—must be developed to enable communication with hundreds of different communities to slow (and stop) the spread of the disease. The Director-General of the WHO has asked you to take point in proposing the solution to the communication nightmare.

She knows that you will have to consider general communication between different cultures and languages, but also provide for more technical communication among diverse and multilingual medical staff across the continent, as well as between any individual doctor and patient.

&quot;_Chari virus is &#39;laughing&#39; at us,&quot; the Director-General wrote you in an email. &quot;It&#39;s defying us to communicate fast enough and well enough to manage infections and explain preventative measures before it engulfs the entire continent.&quot;_

You are aware of the history and uses of lingua francas, and you have investigated constructed languages; you have learned what markup and programming languages can and cannot do; and you have key knowledge about symbolic languages.

Keep in mind, the Chari virus has spread to areas that speak Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan, Niger-Congo, Bantu, and Indo-European languages. Many radio and television stations broadcast in multiple languages (the BBC Worldwide Service, for example, broadcasts in over a dozen languages in Africa, including English, French, Arabic, Berber, Hausa, Somali, Swahili, and Nigerian Pidgin), but remote communities may not have radio reception or Internet access.

Each of these smaller communities is just as important to the WHO as the larger cities. And neither broadcast nor Web services are sufficient for training aid workers, explaining prevention in rural areas (including safe funeral and burial rites), and providing treatment information. The Director-General believes that most of the communication during the initial critical period will be verbal, but also expects signage to be necessary at medical centers and for communicating with isolated villages.

**Please note:** When researching opportunities and threats, you only need to explore the cities/countries affected by the Primary and Secondary transmission zones, as shown on the map. Consider all six (6) of the primary transmission cities (endangered by infected travelers) and at least six (6) different cities that are secondary transmission sites.

**Primary Transmission of Disease (via Air Travel)**

| **City** | **Country** |
| --- | --- |
| Addis Ababa | Ethiopia |
| Cairo | Egypt |
| Casablanca | Morocco |
| Khartoum | Sudan |
| Libreville | Gabon |
| N&#39;Djamena | Chad (where the Chari virus was first identified and reported) |

**Secondary Transmission of Disease (via Air Travel) [Pick 6]**

| **City** | **Country** |
| --- | --- |
| Accra | Ghana |
| Algiers | Algeria |
| Cape Town | South Africa |
| Johannesburg | South Africa |
| Lagos | Nigeria |
| Luanda | Angola |
| Marrakech | Morocco |
| Monrovia | Liberia |
| Nairobi | Kenya |
| Port Louis | Mauritius |
| Tunis | Tunisia |
| Zanzibar City | Zanzibar |
