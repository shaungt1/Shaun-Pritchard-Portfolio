Project Overview

You have been hired as a consultant for a company named FLIGHTZ. This company manages different aspects of airport operations ranging from the physical airports to maintaining the planes in the sky for specific airlines. The CEO of this company has hired you to learn more about the company and will be expecting board-level presentations accompanied by data visualizations. The CEO has scoped out the work and will be providing specific instructions throughout the span of the contract period. The first contract is asking for a creation of a data dictionary and a data governance strategy to help better manage the data for FLIGHTZ. The second contract will work with the same dataset. The CEO would like to learn trends from the data. However, it was also noticed that some data is missing or NULL, so they would like a methodology developed on how to fix that. The third contract will include a presentation to the board of directors about specific findings. The fourth contract will be include a larger dataset that is similar to the dataset obtained in the previous contracts; however, you will need to use SQL to extract trends. The Fifth and Sixth contracts will work with revolve around reducing the dimensionality of the data and using sampling to discover trends with airplane data.

Requirements

This project must have a title and table of contents. There is no length requirement besides making sure that all requirements of the assignment are met. The project must have two references for each assignment. You can use your book as one reference and any search engine for additional references. Wikipedia is not a credible website and may not be used. You may also import pictures, but it is not required.

### [Module 01 Course Project - Airport Restaurant Data Dictionary and Data Governance](https://learning.rasmussen.edu/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_7101694_1&amp;course_id=_77059_1&amp;group_id=&amp;mode=view)

FLIGHTZ is trying to learn more about the restaurants at the airports and the health inspection violations they have collected. The CEO knows very little about what the dataset consists of and would like a data dictionary constructed for each of the columns found within the dataset. In addition to a data dictionary, the CEO is asking that a data governance strategy document be created, so that the company can get a better handle on how to work with the data in the future. The CEO stated that he is busy in the coming weeks and is expecting the data governance strategy document to be three pages or less and they are expecting visualizations within the document to help explain the process.

Deliverables

- Data Dictionary defining each data field name, data type (example varchar), length, expected values, and a brief description (1 sentence). Should be completed in MS Excel.
- Strategy Document should be three pages or less; one page is the data dictionary. This document can be developed in MS Word. Examples can be found at the Data Governance Institute or IBM. Essentially, how would you fix NULL values, missing values, how would you train employees? What Metrics should FLIGHTZ use? What is successful data competition at FLIGHTZ? Have fun with it; strategy can be unique.

## Data Governance

Using the Data Governance Institute PDF, summarize each page with three bullet points. Read other posts and discuss how data governance could benefit an organization. Use what you have learned in previous courses to think about this document and try to think about the document from multiple perspectives (data scientists, data analysts, CEO, CIO, outsider from company)

- Discuss how data governance could benefit an organization with other classmates
- Discuss the importance of data governance from multiple perspectives
