# Advanced Data Analytics

This is an intro to the advanced analytics course I took including the thesis, course projects and full assignments that will attenuate my knowledge and ability to advanced data analytics knowledge. This is only to highlight my aptitude and qualifications of understanding of the topics with proofs, theseus and other advanced concepts.

**Welcome to Advanced Analytics Platforms, Environments, and Software.**

This course focuses on advanced analytics using SAS University Edition. It focuses on developing and deploying Extract Transform Load (ETL) jobs for large data sets. Topics will include how to configure the environment to run the advanced analytic job. The course also focuses on real-time analytics as well. This course will prepare students for developing advanced analytics and ETL jobs. It also prepares students to deploy advanced analytics in the enterprise environment.

We will cover a breadth of related topics, including:

- Real time analytics
- Big data and concept of predictive analytics
- Data extraction process using ETL
- Data modeling and query tuning
- Report generation using SAS
- Advanced analytics execution

A final project is included as a deliverable during this course; as each module is completed, you will perform various steps to resolve the business problem. You will submit a final SAS project during the last module of the course.

Some of the software used in this course is Microsoft only software, therefore if you are using a Macintosh computer you will need to virtualize Windows on your Macintosh computer. You will then be able to run the Microsoft software in the virtualized Windows machine. [Click here for instructions](https://content.learntoday.info/Learn/QMB4200Cfw_Winter_18/Media/How_to_install_Oracle_Virtual_box_and_virtualize_Windows_10.docx) on how to virtualize Windows on your Macintosh computer.

**Microsoft Azure**

You will be provided with login access to a Rasmussen Azure subscription for this course. DO NOT sign up for a free version of Azure, DreamSpark Azure, or a free version of Azure resources such as databases. All the Azure resources you need (such as apps, databases, and servers), aside from third party or extraneous downloads, will be available when you have logged in to the subscription provided. You will be provided with a Rasmussen Azure username that ends in &quot;.supersites.onmicrosoft.com&quot; and password to log into the Rasmussen Azure site at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/). Before you log into your Rasmussen provided Azure subscription for the first time, clear out all of your browser cache, cookies, etc. If you do not receive an email with your Rasmussen Azure username and password, please let your instructor know immediately.

Enjoy the course!

**SAS Environment Setup**

To complete the work in this course, you will need to set up a SAS Environment. It will allow you to follow things.

- Write SAS program
- Debug SAS program
- Access raw data file
- Product analytics results
- Build custom reports

Please download this [file](https://content.learntoday.info/Learn/QMB4200Cfw_Winter_18/Media/sas_setup.pdf)for step-by-step instructions on how to setup your SAS environment.

Tesla company manufactures several types of electric car. Tesla collects data for every single car and runs various types of analytics on the data. They do provide a lot of recommendations based on the analytics output. There are a lot of situations where we need to analyze the real-time data and make decisions. For example, if your car&#39;s brake pads are not working properly. Here is the step by step events that can save your life.

Step 1: Your car is sending the data for each car parts to the data center.

Step 2: Car company is collecting the data and running real-time analytics on it.

Step 3: Car company&#39;s analytics predict a possible failure in brake pad and raise the alert

Step 4: You will get notified via text message or any notification services regarding the possible failure.

Step 5: You stop your car immediately and visit the repair center

Here are some of the components that will be useful for real-time analytics.

**Event Hub:** It is ingestion service that collects, transforms and stores millions of events.

**Stream Analytics:** It connects to the external data sources (Event hub) and update the external database or raise an event based on proposed information

**Project Overview**

You are working as an analytics Developer for a state government of Maryland, and you need to predict police officer recruiting based on the historical crime data. It will help the state government to hire the police officers for the next year. Your script output will be presented as the custom report to state government officers. It will help the state government to hire police officers in the area where crime rates are high.

You need to use SAS University Edition tool and generate a SAS scripts. Your project must include following things.

- SAS Scripts
- ETL job to load data into the database
- Number of crime incidents by City
- Apply scripting standard
- Test SAS script
- It must be original work and include comments throughout your code.

In addition to the above requirements, you will be expected to submit SAS scripts that:

- Run and operate without error
- Are clearly written and readable with clear and sufficient comments.

You can download the raw data files from the **Course Materials** folder.

**Due Date**

**Your final project is due in Module 06.** There will be individual assignments along the way. The module they are due as noted in the time line below.
