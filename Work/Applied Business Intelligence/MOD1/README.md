Business Intelligence (BI) is an old concept that was initially defined as gaining a competitive advantage by gathering information more quickly than your competitors. The modern definition still focuses on gathering information. The ability to quickly gather information is still essential, but businesses now focus on large volumes of data, rather than getting it quickly.

In today&#39;s marketplace, the definition of business intelligence varies from business to business. Each tries to structure the problems in a way that their products and or services become solutions. When it comes to BI, managers, and executives, need to find meaningful information in raw data. The meaningful information provides support for operational decisions, which ultimately contribute to the health and success of the business. In some cases, BI also provides a mechanism to perform simulations on the data to predict the future.

Below is an example of a BI dashboard that provides multiple data visualizations, such as Sales by Product to Sales by Location, Annual Profit Comparisons, and Top Sellable Products.

Data can come from a variety of sources. Less complex BI applications involve using transactional databases that are also being used for other things. This can cause some problems because a transactional database will not perform very well when many reports query against it. Also, adding the additional overhead of a BI infrastructure to an existing database can be tremendously taxing on that database. A more effective solution for data storage for most BI scenarios is a data warehouse, which will be covered in a future module.

Now more than ever before, businesses have access to vast amounts of data. As we rely more heavily on mobile and web applications in our daily lives, it is mind-boggling to imagine the amounts of data produced, collected, and stored. Companies use business intelligence, applications, infrastructure, tools, and best practices, to put this data to work and ultimately make more effective decisions and increase profits.

Business intelligence has 5 major components:

- Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) allows decision makers to strategically monitor aggregated data and view it from different points of view. OLAP is the technology behind business intelligence applications because it allows data discovery, can make complex calculations, and serves as a mechanism for forecasting. Decision makers can use OLAP for &quot;what if&quot; scenarios as well.
- Advanced Analytics refers to tools that allow managers to examine specific analytics to discover more in-depth insights and forecast planning.
- Real-Time Business Intelligence tools provide information as they occur, allowing decision makers to access up-to-date information in real-time.
- Data Sources can vary from SQL, MySQL, Access, and many other database types.
- Data Warehousing serve to consolidate high volumes of data from a variety of data sources.

A business intelligence plan is essential for organizing and understanding your data. Like a business plan, you must identify stakeholders and business requirements, and determine how the five components mentioned above are be used to answer critical business questions. Once those questions have been identified, appropriate data sources and aggregates must be selected to build decision making tools and dashboards.

Your BI plan should include processes used to make your results available for later reference. Stakeholders can measure the impact of the decisions made after studying the data. Typically, BI is an iterative process. Managers and executives need the ability to analyze the data to see what has happened, take action to ensure continued desired results and put a stop to the undesirable ones, and then analyze the data in the future to determine whether the BI plan has contributed to improvements.

A standard approach to designing and implementing a BI plan is to start small and focus on specific problems. Over time, the plan will grow, and emphasis will shift to disseminating information efficiently across the organization. As its BI strategy continues to mature, the organization will interact and explore data more frequently.
