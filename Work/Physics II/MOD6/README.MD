**The Atomic Nucleus and Radiation**

In this lecture we are going to introduce the atomic nucleus and the nature of radioactivity. It is important to have a basic understanding of the structure of the nucleus and the process of nuclear radiation in order to appreciate discussions about nuclear weapons and nuclear power. At the end of the lecture, we will also discuss the different types of radiation, including both natural and artificial, and how they are both harmful and useful.

All of the matter that we interact with on the Earth is made of atoms. An atom contains a nucleus, which is composed of protons and neutrons. Electrons are located outside the nucleus and are proportional to the number of protons. All of the elements known so far are arranged on the periodic table of the elements. The simplest atom is hydrogen which contains one proton and one electron. The elements increase in mass as you move across and down the rows of the periodic table. The atomic number is the number of protons in the atom and the heaviest elements contain the greatest number of protons and neutrons. But let&#39;s step back for a minute and take a look at the discovery of the nucleus.

The physicist who discovered the electron, J.J. Thompson, speculated that the atom was arranged like a plum pudding with a positively charged &quot;pudding&quot; and negatively charged electron &quot;plums&quot;. The physicist Ernest Rutherford was conducting many experiments with radioactive elements, even though it was not yet understood what the structure of the nucleus was. In a famous experiment, Rutherford directed a stream of particles at a very thin sheet of gold foil. Most of these particles passed right through the foil without being deflected. But a few of the particles were deflected and some were even sent straight backward. Rutherford theorized that the particles must have hit something massive in the atoms in the gold foil and he names the core of the atom the atomic nucleus.

The nucleus is composed of particles called protons and neutrons. It is easy to remember the charges of these particles: &quot;P&quot; is for the positive proton and &quot;N&quot; is for the neutral neutron. The protons and neutrons each have about the same mass and are more than 2000 times heavier than the electrons. The protons and neutrons are held together or attracted to each other by a force called the strong nuclear force. The electrons, which are not illustrated in this slide, move around or orbit the nucleus.

Even before the structure of the atoms was understood to have a massive nucleus, it was known that certain elements could emit or send out particles. This is because a large nucleus is more unstable than a smaller nucleus. The strong nuclear force is much weaker for the protons and neutrons located on the outside of the nucleus. These elements will &quot;decay&quot; or emit energy and particles spontaneously. This process is called radioactive decay or radioactivity.

Radioactive Paradox

Radioactivity was discovered jointly by the French scientist Henri Becquerel, Polish physicist Marie Curie, and her husband, French physicist Pierre Curie. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1903 for their discovery of radioactivity. The effects of this type of radiation were largely unknown, but Marie Curie did caution against people using the radioactive element radium for certain medial uses, including drinking it! Unfortunately, Marie Curie died from a condition likely cause by the exposure to the ionizing radiation.

The nucleus of an atom can emit different types of particles and radiation. The least dangerous are the alpha particles, which are simply the nuclei of helium atoms and contain two protons and two neutrons. Alpha particles cannot pass through the skin and can be stopped by just a thin sheet of paper. Beta particles have more energy and are more dangerous than alpha particles, but they are also easily stopped by a thin sheet of foil or even plastic. This type of radiation is made of very fast moving electrons and positrons. A naturally occurring source of beta particles is potassium-40 of which bananas and certain other foods contain a significant amount. In fact, potassium-40 is present in the human body and is constantly giving off beta particles as it decays. The most damaging type of nuclear radiation are gamma rays which have very high energies. This radiation needs to be shielded by a large amount of lead, depending on the energy of the gamma rays. This type of radiation is created in the fission process in nuclear reactors.

While radiation can be harmful, it is also very useful for many different applications. For example, many modern smoke alarms or detectors use a source of alpha particles to detect when smoke is present. Food, both fresh produce and canned items, can be irradiated in order to kill harmful organisms. In fact, some of the food consumed by astronauts is irradiated to prevent illness occurring during an extremely inconvenient time! This food is safe to eat because the radiation simply passes through, killing the harmful organisms, without causing the food itself to become radioactive. There are also many uses for nuclear radiation in medicine, from using radiogenic isotopes to image different parts of the body to treating cancer with gamma radiation. There are also naturally occurring elements in the Earth&#39;s crust. The energy given off by these elements is partly responsible for the Earth&#39;s remaining molten. Without radioactive heating, there would be no volcanoes! By measuring how much the radioactive elements decay, it is also possible to calculate the ages of many different types of rocks. Because of this process, we have a fairly good idea of how old the Earth and Moon are.

It is important to take a look at the background radiation or the radiation that we are exposed to everyday. From this graph we can see that the majority of radiation that we are exposed to is not from nuclear power plants or nuclear weapons. In fact, a large proportion of our exposure is from radon gas which naturally occurs in the Earth. Another significant contribution is from buildings and soli and from the food and water that we drink. Another significant contribution is from medicine from certain medical procedures that use radiation for diagnosis. Only a very small fraction, shown in red, is radiation that is from nuclear sources.

While it is important to understand the process of nuclear radiation, it is also necessary to recognize that it is very safe when used properly. Our everyday lives would be very different if we did not make use of radioactivity!

**Nuclear Weapons**

The development of atomic weapons remains one of the most controversial developments in the history of physics. As our knowledge of atomic physics increased, so did our understanding of how to use the enormous energies that can be released from the atom. For the first time, the research conducted by scientists mattered to all of humanity in a very concrete way. Their work was no longer limited to a laboratory but was used during a time of war, affecting millions of people directly and starting a debate which continues to this day and will likely not end anytime in the near future.

Many scientists recognized the dangers associated with the existence of nuclear weapons. While Albert Einstein was initially in favor of developing atomic weapons in order to remain ahead of Germany during the war, he regretted his decision to urge President Roosevelt to develop America&#39;s nuclear weapons program. Einstein later said in 1947 that &quot;had I known that the Germans would not succeed in developing an atomic bomb, I would have done nothing.&quot; J. Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Manhattan Project, which was the program that researched and built the atomic bombs used on Japan at the end of World War II.

Atomic weapons are possible because of the discovery of nuclear fission or the splitting of the nucleus of an atom. It was discovered in 1938 that when the element uranium was bombarded by neutrons, that the uranium was split into smaller nuclei with very high energies and an enormous amount of energy was released. If enough uranium is present, the neutrons released during the fission process would cause other uranium to also split, releasing more neutrons and continuing the chain reaction.

Because of the amount of energy released by even a very small amount of material, the fission process is very useful for generating power and, as already mentioned, for making weapons. In the United States, atomic weapons were developed first, in 1945, and the first nuclear power plant was not operational until 1951.

The destroyer of worlds?

The Manhattan project was formally approved by President Roosevelt in October of 1941. The Army was chosen to administer the program; the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer was selected as the scientific director for the site at Los Alamos, New Mexico, where the bomb was actually developed and tested. The program was expensive, costing over $24 billion dollars in the end with the vast majority of the money spent on the infrastructure needed to produce and refine uranium. The Manhattan Project continued even after the war with numerous weapons tests, medical research, and nuclear power technology developed for the Navy.

There were many sites as part of the Manhattan Project, which was done on purpose in order to prevent any one location from being able to have off of the materials necessary to build the bomb. Only during the final test in 1945 did many of the people associated with the project realize what the real purpose of the project was. The site at Los Alamos in northern New Mexico was the location of a number of prominent physicists who were working on the design of the bomb. Other sites in Tennessee and Washington state were essential in producing the heavy elements needed for the fission processes.

The physicists, engineers, and other scientists and support personnel began working at Los Alamos in 1943 and by July of 1945 were ready to test the first nuclear weapon ever built. A site in southern New Mexico was chosen at the White Sands Proving Ground, an area that is remote and far from the large city of Albuquerque. The Trinity device, called the &quot;Gadget&quot; by many of the people working at the site.

The Trinity test took place at 5:30am local time on July 16, 1945. There were a number of people present to observe the test, some at distances of 9km and others located 20 miles away. The explosion was observed by people located hundreds of miles away. Information about the test was made public only after the bombing at Hiroshima.

The director Oppenheimer recalled thinking of the enormous power that the United States was now in possession of and said &quot;Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.&quot; General Thomas Farrell described what he observed during the test: &quot;The effects could well be called unprecedented, magnificent, beautiful, stupendous and terrifying. No man-made phenomenon of such tremendous power had ever occurred before.&quot;

Only a few weeks later, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. The destruction and loss of life was horrific. Three days later, the second and final bomb to be used as a weapon during war was dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, again causing almost unimaginable death and destruction. The Japanese government signalled their surrender almost immediately.

The development and testing of atomic weapons continued after the war, with the Soviet Union and the United States being the first to develop the even more power hydrogen bomb, which uses a combination of fission and fusion. Other countries also tested their own nuclear weapons. As more and more countries began to develop their weapons programs, it became clear that there was a need to both discourage further development of weapons and to possibly begin the disarmament process.

The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT was first signed in 1968, was enforced in 1970, and was extended indefinitely in 1995. The treaty has three pillars: non-proliferation, disarmament, and peaceful use of nuclear energy. The first pillar means that nations with nuclear weapons agree not to transfer the weapons or technology to nations that do not yet have nuclear capability. Nations that are not yet nuclear weapons also agree not to acquire them. The second pillar, disarmament, has not been as easy to define as some nations interpret the treating to mean that nations with weapons must immediately begin to disarm themselves. Nations that currently have nuclear weapons interpret the treaty to mean that they will work towards disarmament when international relations are such that nuclear weapons are no longer needed. The third pillar, peaceful use of nuclear technology, allows those who have signed to treaty to use and transfer nuclear technology and materials as long as they are not being used to develop weapons.

There are a few countries who possess nuclear weapons and have not agreed to sign the treaty: India, Pakistan, and Israel have never signed the treaty and North Korea withdrew their signature in 2003. These countries continue the development of nuclear weapons and will likely not agree to sign a treaty until conflict between the nations is reduced or eliminated.

The development and use of nuclear weapons has led many people, scientists included, to carefully examine what the role of science should be in society. While there were some scientists who refused to participate in the development of the atomic bomb, and scientists today who do not contribute to weapons research, many others will continue to develop new technologies, some of which may be used for war and defense purposes. Scientists can only discover and invent new technologies. The decision about how to use the knowledge we have is for society to make as a whole. The need to make these choices will be present for as long as we continue to learn and discover more about our world.

**Nuclear Power**

The issues surrounding the use of nuclear power are complex and involve many factors, including the safety of nuclear reactors, the cost to build, operate and maintain them, and the possible advantages and disadvantages the use of nuclear power. In this lecture, we will discuss the physics of the fission process, how power is generated, and the safety concerns associated with radiation produced by nuclear reactors.

An enormous amount of energy is contained within the extremely small nucleus of the atom. All atomic nuclei, except for hydrogen which contains only one proton, contain specific numbers of protons and neutrons depending on the type of element. Particles with like charges, such as two positive charges or two negative charges, will repel because of the electrostatic force. The nucleus is held together by the strong nuclear force.

The process of nuclear fission, or the &quot;splitting&quot; of the atom, was discovered in 1938 and 1939 by a number of scientists who were studying what happened when heavy elements such as uranium were bombarded by neutrons. They discovered that small nuclei were created when the neutrons &quot;split&quot; the atom and named this process fission after the biological process of cell division. Here is an example of fission in uranium-235, and elements containing 92 protons and 143 neutrons. When a neutron impacts the nucleus, an unstable or &quot;excited&quot; form of uranium is created. This unstable nucleus splits into two lighter nuclei, emits three neutrons, and radiation in the form of gamma rays. The gamma radiation is very high frequency and is what is damaging to people.

Because so much energy is stored in such a small amount of mass, the fission process can generate an enormous amount of power. For example, an amount of uranium-235 equal to a grain of rice is equivalent the same amount of energy that can be generated by burning 14 barrels of oil!

There are two uranium isotopes that occur naturally in the Earth - uranium-238 and uranium-235. The focus of this lecture is on uranium-235 which is considered a &quot;fissile&quot; material because it can be induced to split by using a slow-moving neutron. All of the uranium present in the Earth was created many millions of years ago in supernova explosions which are caused by a dying star. Uranium deposits are found primarily in Canada, Australia, and Kazakhstan. Uranium-235 makes up less than 1% of natural uranium and needs to be refined to produce a high enough concentration to be used in nuclear reactors.

When a chain reaction is initiated in a nuclear reactor, the energy released is used to generate electricity. Heat is produced by the fission process and is used to heat water and produce steam, which powers a turbine and generates electricity. The water is cooled and condenses back into liquid water and is used to circulate through the system again. This is a relatively simple example of how a nuclear reactor generates electricity.

Please put on your safety goggles...

The safety concerns relating to the operation of a nuclear reactor can be summarized by three main points: control the reactivity, cool the fuel, and contain the radioactive material. First, we already have looked at chain reactions and how they are controlled using different materials to absorb the neutrons and stop the reaction. It is also important that the fuel not become too hot because if the temperature increases too much, the material containing the uranium fuel can melt and the reaction could be uncontrollable, resulting in a nuclear meltdown! The third safety concern is to contain the radioactive material. The fuel rods are housed in steel casings and thick concrete walls, possibly up to a meter thick. All of these systems are monitored carefully and the reactor core is designed with many back-up systems.

However, there have been three major incidents where nuclear reactor containment failed, at least partially, and there was a breach of the reactor core, with radioactive materials released into the environment. The only incident in the United States took place at the Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. A cooling circuit malfunction, allowing the temperature in the reactor core to rise, melting and damaging the core. Gas containing radioactive material was released into the atmosphere but it was not enough to raise the background radiation by any significant amount and no health effects have been reported.

The most serious incident took place in 1986 in the Ukraine at the Chernobyl reactor when the workers were conducting a test. Because of poor reactor design and an automatic shutdown mechanism being disabled, heat and steam began to build up, causing an explosion which released an enormous amount of radiation into the environment. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated and thousands of people developed certain types of cancer, mainly thyroid, as a result of the radiation exposure.

The most recent event was at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor in Japan. The very large earthquake in March of 2011 caused the reactor to shut down but the subsequent tsunami flooded the facility, damaging the generator which supplied power to the cooling system. The fuel in the core began to heat up, resulting in explosion which released radioactive material into the air. Water around the core was also contaminated, and clean-up continued for at least two years after the initial incident. The amount of radiation is expected to result in increase in certain types of cancers by only a very small amount.

Even if a nuclear reactors operates normally and does not release any radioactive materials into the environment, the spent fuel still needs to be safely disposed of. Nuclear waste is classified by three different levels, with the high-level waste being the most radioactive and requiring special measure to both handle and dispose of the material. The radioactive waste created during the fission process is what makes up most of the waste at a nuclear reactor. The used fuel can either be stored as waste as is done in the US and Canada or recycled, which is done in Europe and Japan.

Currently, the spent fuel is stored at the reactor site, either underwater which absorbs the heat and protects from the radiation, or in concrete storage containers. The radioactivity of the materials decreases significantly over 40-50 years and can eventually be stored permanently.

Currently in the United States, there is only one location where nuclear waste is being stored which is at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. This facility consists of storage rooms more than 2000 feet underground in salt mine. The WIPP site is only for waste from defense applications but this type of facility could also be used to store spent fuel. There is also the possibility for drilling deep holes in regions with certain geological characteristics and disposing of the waste in this way.

Aside from the considerations of safety, there are other environmental impacts involved with using nuclear power. Our energy has to come from somewhere. The more nuclear power that is used, the less we will use of other energy sources such as fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. That is not to say that all of our power should be generated by nuclear reactors. There are differing economic factors as to whether it makes sense to build and operate a certain number of power plants in certain locations.

Ce la vie...

As of 2014, there are 437 nuclear reactors operating in 31 countries and generating just over 10% of the world&#39;s electricity. The country that generates most of its electricity from nuclear power is France followed by a number of countries in Eastern and Western Europe that generate at least a third of their power from nuclear reactors. The United States currently generates about 20% of its electricity from nuclear power, similar to both Canada and the United Kingdom. Japan, not shown on the graph, is currently only generating about 1% of its electricity from nuclear power but is expected to return to its pre-earthquake level of about 25%.

While nuclear power is becoming more significant for power generation in a number of countries, there are other very useful application of both reactors and radioactive processes. The first nuclear submarine became operational in 1954. Nuclear powered submarines can travel over great distances at high speeds without needing to refuel. The disadvantage is that the equipment is expensive and currently there are a limited number of nuclear submarines.

Using a technology that is different than a nuclear reactor but still relies on the radioactive properties of matter are numerous spacecraft. A radioisotope thermoelectric generator or RTG converts heat released by radioactive decay into electricity. RTH are used in satellites and manned and unmanned spacecraft. Without this power source, many of these missions would not have taken place, including the exploration of Mars and the Apollo lunar landings.

Nuclear power will likely remain a politically charged issue for the foreseeable future. While nuclear power represents an alternative to fossil fuel energy sources, it is important to carefully examine all aspects of nuclear technology, especially safety concerns and the disposal of nuclear waste.
